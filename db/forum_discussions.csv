4849,34747,"Second Time Around","This is my second marriage and by God's grace, the last one.  I've mentioned b4 that I'm from a small town in Louisiana. However, my first wedding was huge. I had 12 bridesmaids and I went out of my way to accomodate all of them. Needless to say, I felt deprived and disappointed on my wedding day. I had about 300 people attend the wedding, all of whom are not close friends.  This time, I'm in another state and I consider this my first true love.  I want an intimate ceremony with only 4-5 bridesmaids.  I will also only invite about 125-150 guest.  The only thing is, in Houston it is very costly to have a traditional wedding vs. the amount I paid for the first cinderella themed wedding.  So, I chose this little bed and bath spot (which is very elegant and 1950's), located in the suburbs of Houston.  I'm happy with it but I would like my guest to feel like I've tried to accomodate them.  I've traveled to weddings before and I would hope that they will not feel this is out of the way.

She had been dating her fiance for the past 5 years.  He is a Marine and has been deployed twice to Iraq.  The only hurry was that they just were tired of being apart from one another and felt this was the best thing to do so they could be together and start the life they wanted.  He is still in the service and they are very happy together. Because of the short amt of time...we were unable to invite many guests to the wedding or have a wedding shower.  As her mother I feel it is only right for her to have a shower.  They are just starting out and have basically nothing.  Is it wrong to have a shower at my house for them and just invite close friends and family?  They have moved to NC from MI...I would like to plan this shower to take place in the next 4-6 weeks.

5142,45217,"alone or not?","I have no parents, this has not proved a problem for me until recently, many of the people around me have been scandalized that I intend to walk down the aisle alone, and seem to think my uncle, whom I have only met once after 20 years of knowing no one in my family, should perform this task, they also think he should lead me in the father daughter dance. While I dislike causing a scene I am not comfortable with this idea, what do I do? It seems wrong to replace my father, even though I have not seen him in 14 years but also very rude to not allow my uncle to take over these tasks.My mothers side of the family hates the idea of someone from my fathers side having anything to so with the wedding,while I have had very little contact with anyone growing up, suddenly everyone has an opinion,and not one of them good.

We are having a hard time deciding on colors for our attendants - Victorian Lilac (a dusty purple) or Peridot (a light sage green).  The wedding will take place in July.  

This begs the question, what color does my fiancee go with if I choose a champagne or silver dress?  Black?  Gray?  Chocolate brown?  Taupe?  We don't want to look like twins!

I imagine if I go with the champagne, the best colors to choose would be the peridot and the chocolate brown or taupe ... and if I go with the silver, we should go with the lilac and black.

As you can see, our wedding is set to take place a little under 4 months from now. We're keeping the date for now, as I just found out about it.

He wants an open relationship, where we can be completely honest about the people to whom we are attracted, and can have friendships with a sexual aspect to them on occasion. This proposition seems pretty natural to him. (Please don't tell me it's an excuse for his cheating--I've heard the arguments for it, and I don't agree.)

My question is...how do I forgive him? Can I? Has anyone else gone through this that can give me some words of advice?

People have told me to leave him now, but I'm not sure I want to. Heck, the open marriage thing sounds fine. It's the cheating I'm having trouble with. I can't stand to think about it.

We went to men's warehouse and their tie selection is awful. We live in San Diego - the wedding is in Maryland - and groomsmen are all over the country. Does anyone know where he can get this look? 

 

Thanks so much! ","Style And Decor"

I've wanted a western theme for years and had some great ideas.  However, my younger brother got married 5 years ago and my sister-in-law took the theme.  The main problem is that my sister-in-law is the type that would do a couple things....be offended, go around telling everyone I stole her ideas, or go around telling everyone that it was her idea.  So, I was thinking of plan B...a princess theme but that mainly centers around Cinderella.  Though I like Disney I just don't want it in my wedding.  HELP please!","Style And Decor"

You were so helpful with my color question I decided to turn to you all again. I am having a small wedding (30 guests) followed by a buffet dinner reception at the same site. I had invisioned a long banquet table type set up so it feels like we are all sitting together, however the venue doesn't do that. They have REALLY pretty round tables (already decorated), but with so few guests there will be either 2-3 or 7-9 people at a table. I won't be able to even it out based on how my family will be comfortable and I'm afraid our two families won't interact much since some have health problems and can't be mingling around the room. Also, we really wanted to sit with everyone and if we do it this way we have to pick (NO WAY I'm doing that:)someones feelings would get hurt for sure) Any suggestions to make the round tables work better?

But I am concerned that the ""lost"" invites and the ""New"" Invites may collide. And my budget is really a factor. What confusion. Talk about a nightmare. Can someone help me.

I am not a big ""flower"" person and have decided to go with the silk flowers for bouquets, bouts, etc since I feel like real flowers are kind of a waste.  yea they smell good but then you pay all that money and they are dead in 3 days.  So really, what's the point?  I also looked online and they were cheaper.  However, I am getting feedback from a couple of vendors that they are actually more expensive so now I don't know what to do.  Has anyone done silk flowers and what did you think vs. real?

Although everything went to $**! at first.  The DJ would not return my calls or anything so I was without any music and then the rehersal dinner, well we could not find the phone number and my bridal shower... talk about a nightmare.  The rehersal dinner worked out thanks to my mother-in-law, she got everyone there who needed to be there and it was exactly what we wanted.  However on the way back to my sister-in-laws the front tire blew on the freeway. So we had to wait for the men to come save us.
My hunny being the perfect man he is took care of the DJ thing.  He asked his cousin to do it and he was perfect.  Better than any professional DJ could have ever been. I was so impressed.  
All in all it was the best day.  Even with my untraditional blue dress.  So MUCH FUUUUUNNNNNN!!!

I recently got engaged and have started thinking about wedding dates. For a multitude of reasons (fiance finishing school, availability during the time of year I would like to get married, etc...) I would like to wait until Nov. 2010. I was wondering how early it is okay to set a date. Also, I would appreciate any advice from those that had long engagements or are currently in long engagements.

Thanks!",Planning

Me and my fiance, are planning on getting married in August 2009. We're paying for the wedding completely on our own and I've budgeted MAX, $10,000 most of which I'd like spent on the reception and our honeymoon. 

First off, does it cost anything to have your wedding on the beach? I know it might sound dumb, but I was just wondering if you have to go through the city at all. 

Second, I figured we can rent chairs, some sort of archway possibly, probably put a few fake flowers on the chairs on the inside of the isle, get an officiant for $200 if not free (my mom's boyfriend is a minister)and I can't think of much else we would need.

It's going to be a fairly simple wedding, 50 to 75 guests, simple dresses for the girls, kaki pants and nice dress shirts for the guys. 

Any ideas for a cheap beach wedding would help. Thank you!",Planning

My fiance and I are planning on having a fairly small wedding reception (75 people), and had booked a very nice restaurant in our city to hold it.  We did this very early in our planning, and felt we had gotten everything taken care of pretty easily... however, we should have known it would not be that easy.  For some reason, we were under the impression that we had the restaurant's backroom reserved from 5-9... however, when we called to confirm recently, they said it was only reserved from 4:30-7:30!  And, if we wanted more time, we would have to pay double the minimum we were originally going to pay!  We would very much like to keep the reception there, however, I dont know how excited my parents will be with double the bill!  

We are only 6 months out, and other venues are filling up fast... does anyone have any suggestions for creative (indoor places) to have a reception??

I think that wearing a crystal or rhinestone necklace maybe too much, my dress is heavily beaded with pearls and crystals on the top portion of it. 


What do you think? would it be too much to wear a necklace or not? I want to keep the simple but elegant look for myself, so I think it would be too much.

As of right now, I'm working Thursday, flying to the site Friday and getting married Saturday.  Is that completely nuts?  I'll probably leave a little early on Thursday afternoon, but that's not a whole lot of time.  I like the sound of a day or two to prepare, but then I start thinking about what I'd actually *do* with that time.   Other than packing, I can't think of anything at all, which makes me feel like I'm missing something.  Is there a pre-wedding secret or something I should add to my to-do list?

They never return my calls, emails, and never show up on time when they are suppose to be open. I got so mad that I actually went there in person and no one showed up. I waited an hour after they were suppose to open.... still no one. My FI said I shouldnt worry because its 6 months till the wedding and they have other brides that are getting married sooner so the venue is busy. I understand that but after waiting 2 months for a response I think its a little much.

Now, my matron of honor and bridesmaids are including them with my bridal shower invites, but then the ladies invited will be the only ones that know where we're registered.  Here's our true question... we think it's great that people are thoughtful to get us gifts not from our registry, but if people are going to get us gifts instead of giving us money, than we'd rather have gifts from our registry for our wedding.  However, we are needing monetary (money) gifts more than physical gifts.

13751,93760,"Who should walk Groom? MOG or MOB?","Let me clarify, it is the Bride?s wish to have MOB walk the Groom, because she does not like the MOG and she does not want MOB to also walk her down with her Father because she says ?They only do that in Jewish Weddings!? However, the Bride?s official statement is ?everyone will be paired evenly? if MOB walks the Groom, because the M&FOG will walk together.  As opposed to following tradition and having her Mother walk with an Usher or GM.
It is not the Grooms desire to walk down with the MOB, however he is not opposed for 2 reasons 1) fear of the Bride and 2) he doesn?t know general Wedding Etiquette (as they announced their engagement 2 days before my wedding and showed the ring and talked about their plans on my Big Day) So what should he do? In an effort to prevent a family problem and to stop Bride from further distancing the Groom from his family, should I, as a relative of the Groom, let the Groom know this is inappropriate? Or should I say nothing and let them make a mistake?

We had dated for almost 2 years and were going to get pictures done for the first time. My parents also wanted to do pictures. We all went to get them done at the same time. My family went first then me, my FH and my son. 
When it came time to do just me and my FH they posed us standing up for the first one, then she directed him to kneel down like we were going to do a picture on the floor. He got down on one knee, I still had no clue till I looked at him and he had the ring out and proposed right there in the picture.  I was totally not expecting it. It was amazing of him to plan that out- making sure my family could see it and being able to capture the moment in a photo. It was perfect.

13834,70212,"Please help! Freaking out!","Hi,

I'm really losing my patience here. We got engaged in December, but he wasn't ready to shop for the ring until January (we fought, then got through to his fears, then he was OK) and then in February I brought up setting the date. 

He wanted to wait because getting engaged was a big step for him. This will be a second marriage for both of us. I've been divorced for a long time, but he only got divorced 4 years ago and met me 2 years ago from when we got engaged, and I was his first date. The first year was off and on rough for both of us but then we committed to stay together and the second year was very stable and just a joy.

Anyway, he asked to wait until after tax season to set a date because he's an accountant (as well as this being difficult for him) so I say yes.

I was so excited April 17th, but then he said he needed to wait longer because he'd been assigned to make both Passover seders for the first time, for his extended family the first night and then his nuclear family the second. I heard how frazzled he was so I said OK and was very supportive with the seders and not bringing it up.

OK so now we are a week later, the next weekend. And he finally brought it up because he sensed I was melancholy but I didn't want to be the one to bring it up again.

We have some logistics to work out and we knew that, but figured we could live apart and commute like we do now until I can move to his state (40 minute drive away) in 2011. I want to get married in 2010, because in 2011 my child is graduating H.S. and starting college and one of his children is having a bar-mitzvah.

So he said then it has to be 2012! Because he wants to be living together when we get married.

I suggested the end of 2010, so we'd only be living apart for 6 months. He needs to think about it!

I'm going crazy and feeling rejected and abandoned because I keep being patient but setting the date is dragging out more and more.

Also I'm willing to move out of my state and town that I love but thought it was fair that he sell his house (which he was married and divorced in) so that we can buy our own house that we picked out instead of his ex-wife and so that it feels like it's my place too...instead of just moving into his house, since I'm leaving my state for him...he doesn't want to do this either.

It was a rough Friday night discussing all this and I couldn't sleep...but we felt better Saturday morning and had a wonderful day and night. 

He was so attentive and just saying over and over when I asked his preference for the day, that he didn't care, he just wanted to be with me. But also he said half-joking during sex Saturday morning, how we can't get married because married sex won't be as good.

Then while we were out, he says ""Don't look."" Across the street was a bride and groom and wedding and limo and church. I hadn't even noticed it. He said half-joking, ""Don't get any ideas."" He didn't even have to bring it up, I wouldn't have even noticed it. I joked back and then turned my back on it but he seemed to keep watching the wedding scene.

This morning while I was sleeping I hear ""I'm going home."" That's how I got woken up on a Sunday morning! I knew he was leaving some time today, but...I freaked out, I couldn't react better, I was sleeping = subconscious. 

Now we're in a fight and I don't want to answer my phone if he does call, and I just want to tell his family when they ask about our wedding date that we're not getting married, we're just staying engaged so that we can have good unmarried sex and he can come and go as he pleases. I hate feeling like I'm passive and pursuing him and just a fool.

Please help, I don't want to be chasing him or passive and I don't want to be a b*&^! The only option I can think of is to never bring it up again and when family members ask us I say we're not going to and act like I don't want to anymore.",Planning
