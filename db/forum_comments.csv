4433,38901,"""Legally their name is Mr. and Mrs. __________ and the invitation should be addressed as such.""

That doesn't sound right.  Legally, name change paperwork is a separate process from getting a marriage certificate.  If a bride didn't fill out the separate paperwork to change her name, legally, her name remains the same.  From what I've seen, and I'm no expert, courthouses will usually include the paperwork for a name change in case one or both couples would like to change their name while the couple is getting their marriage certificate--but that doesn't mean that once they're married their name automatically changes.

All of that said... I would stick with Mr. ____ and Ms. ____.  I don't know if that's proper etiquette, but it certainly indicates respect on your part for the name decision of each party."
4377,38901,"Of course, this doesn't help you now... sorry... but we sent our ""mark your calendar"" reminders with our holiday greetings.  Two birds with one stone.  To cut costs further--and this may be seen by some as too informal--we made our holiday greeting correspondence a postcard.  Less postage that way.  

Just remember to ""household"" your guests as you gather how many cards you need--we printed about twice as many postcards as we needed!  : )   Good luck!"
4499,38243,"I am getting married in 2/2009 and my fiance and I have planned for a black and white wedding.  The bridesmaids will wear black and carry red flowers.  The flower girl is wearing black and white.  I, as the bride, with be in white.  I think it will be appropriate.  My mom love's the idea.  I think it willl be great.  Also, I have all ""sized"" b-maids too so I'm comfortable with them each choosing the dres they feel comfortable in as long as the fabric comes from the same lot (otherwise it will show in pics).  Great choice.  Good Luck!"

4518,26876,"I would not agree to it, and would reconsider marrying. I think that there is a deeper issue here. I wouldn't be able to marry someone who does not trust me. I don't think a polygraph test would stregthen our relationship, because how can my partner trust a machine over me? If machine seems more trust worthy than me than there is a big problem! Besides if I take it today, will my partner want me to take one every time they doubt me? If you can't trust me today, you can't trust me at all, thats how I see it. Good luck to you and hopefully you make the right choice for you."
4520,26876,"if you haven't done so, you can write each other songs and sing them or have someone sing them for you during the ceremony, or reception. A Friend of mine did that and she sang it during the ceremony, it was very romantic and just sweet and brave of her to do."
4518,18635,"One thing that the previous posters didn't comment on, that is key....In your post you said ""Your fiance has GOOD reason to believe you are cheating""  That says a lot.  But then you also say you know you did not cheat.  This is a really tough situation.  Their really needs to be a reassessment done of this relationship.  Polygraph...I say NO.  Premarital counseling...YES!  There is no way a polygraph could strengthen the relationship.  It would only add a false sense of security and trust.  
Hope this helps."
4480,39393,"Hi Petunia,

Sometimes us photographers get carried away in the moment :( I'm sorry that this happened to you. A fun suggestion if your in-law lives close by is to have a special daughter/ mother in-law session. Find a good portrait/lifestyle photographer who can take you for a ""girls day out"". Travel to your favorite stores, go the park, the garden, the aquarium....get creative. Plus, you may actually have a really good time!

Happy New Years

4554,21407,"No- none of your bridesmaids have to be married. The one that stands up for you, eg. the closest one you make as your maid of honour or matron of honour- here is the difference. If they are single, they are considered the maid of honour, if married, they are the matron of honour. The rest are your bridesmaids, junior bridesmaid, or flowergirl, depending on who is in your wedding party.  Same goes for the men.  The best man, is just that, whether married or not. "
968,39625,"I'm sending mine to http://madamepaulette.com/services-bridal.php, Madame Paulette in NY, I've sent her tons of my evening gowns and they come back beautifully. My fiance has gotten our contractor to build a special enclosed corner in our walk in closet for me to put my wedding dress on display (we purchased a model/bodice..and got appropriate lighting so it doesn't damage the dress) so it will sit behind glass casing for me to admire.
You may want to preserve the memories of that day, so check Madame Paulette."

The three steps are totally easy and convenient. The package comes with everything you need, and is much safer than other at home whitening kits.
Awesome part is you only have to use it for 7 days and there's no disgusting taste."
4547,39625,"Groom's cakes are always fun, not required but fun. Chose a flavor and theme, a hobby he enjoys is always a great idea. 

This is what I found: Traditionally, a groom's cake was sliced and boxed for the unmarried girls attending the wedding to take home and place under their pillows in hopes that the man they dreamed of would be their future husband.
"
4560,4007,"Sigh! Some people should listen to their mothers!(e.g. eat what is ioffered to you!) I have lots of food allergies, so I understand where she is coming from BUT, as a guest, its my job to eat what I'm able to, and be charming and good company to my host and hostess. If there is nothing I am able to eat, then I don't eat (but get something before or afterward.) Unfortunately, it doesn't even sound like she's allergic -just picky. Any french restaurant is likely to serve chicken, but it won't be plain (as is coq au vin, cassoulet etc., game hen)and iceberg lettuce is back in style. She should be able to find something. I would suggest you simply say, ""Oh, I'm sorry but that is the menu we selected for our special day. You're welcome to join us for dinner or just dessert if that works better for you."" She can choose at that point what she chooses to do. "
4560,39625,"Thank you for the suggestion. Being raised in a five star fine dinning french restaurant, my palate is always adventurous. Unfortunately this is a 7 course dinner, where nothing on the menu is to her taste(I've shown her the menu and she practically vommited). So I've decided I will not pay for someone to sit in a chair and not eat. I'm meeting her this weekend to let her know she's welcome to come for dessert and champagne, or to the rehearsal dinner and the brunch the day after the wedding."
4411,11213,"I'm a mother in law.  When my son was married the bride included me with everything.  Sometimes the groom's mom is left out of things.  She should be thankful that you have included her.  Maybe she's the kind that if you didn't include her she would complain about that too.  It's hard to make everyone happy.  "
4558,11213,"I know it's a lot of planning that you're doing but I think it's really nice of you to do all that in different locations.  Most people would have it one place & who comes, comes.  i hope your guests & family appreciate all that your doing. Good luck!"
4518,11213,"I agree with Christina.  I would never take the test.  If my word isn't enough, too bad.  I have never cheated or even been close. I've been married 32 years.  Sometimes it gets worse after you get married & he will become more suspecious.  It could be a very hard thing to live with. "

4621,18635,"Just a thought here...you are concerned about uneven sides but also about your sister and alterations.  Is your sister your MOH or Bridesmaid?  My thought, if she is trying so hard NOT to spend any money at all give her the option of bowing out gracefully.  This means you would have your MOH and balance things out a little more.  "
4620,18635,"If your sister's dress fits poorly than she needs to have alterations done.  It comes to a point that you and your fiancee have to stop and think about enjoying the planning and the actual day of your wedding.  It is NOT your obligation to bend and flex for everyone.  As I mentioned in another post of yours, consider giving your sister the option of not being in the wedding if it is really burdensome for her.  

My sister and I had to talk about what expectations I may have as well as how many trips from NY to MD she'd need to make.  This all took place prior to her accepting.  In order to avoid problems down the road this was neccesary.  

Let her know you understand the finacial burden and that you would understand if she could not be in your wedding.  You can also ask for assistance with planning and other things as a substitue to being a bridemaid.  She can do a poetry reading in honor of you.  The options are endless.  "
4480,39825,"Both photographers have given you great advice.

There is so much that happens at weddings, that this is the one part that I require my clients to do a little homework on. There are no typical picture groupings anymore when it comes to formals  - and most clients of mine these days seem to shy away from formals, so within less than 15 minutes, we wrap up formals with  - Bride & Groom, B&G with wedding party (sometimes just girls and one with just guys), B&G with parents (each side) and B&G with each side of the immediate family.

I typically have the bride put together a list of less than 15 groupings and give that to my assistant. I usually ask the bride or the planner to help wrangle the group together.

Formals are quickly becoming less of a focal point for clients, so just explain to your mom that you did not provide a list to the photographer and take the advice of the other two - plan a special session and have some relaxed images created for her. I am sure she will love it!"
55,22139,"I sell lia sophia jewelry and have had a number of hostesses who purchased jewelry items for their bridesmaids. For example, one hostess bought beautiful cz heart necklaces for all her bridesmaids that they could wear with their dresses and then keep after the wedding. Just something to think about."
4558,39914,"Wow, a cousin of mine had the same situation. Instead of the three weddings, she had the main wedding videotaped and sent it to her family and friends across the USA. Then, she had to reception parties in two different places...one in MD and the other in CA. It worked well...and she didn't have to worry about all the wedding stuff in three different places. "
4453,39914,"Wow, did you pick her to be your bridesmaid in the first place? If so, there was something that made you want her to be in the wedding. However, as a to-be bride, you're entitled to change your mind. If you feel or think you will feel uncomfortable as your day approaches, let your to-be fiance know and then let the woman know. Question, what bothers you know or what do you think will happen? Remember, he's marrying you...not her. This is the time for you to be happy...if she hasn't come between you in the past, I really wouldn't worry about it now. You need to have a beautiful face when you walk down that aisle. I hope this helps. :-)"
4411,39914,"This can be hard, but you can make it a bit easier in hopes that some stress is lifted off of your shoulders. Is there anything in regards to your wedding or reception that your future mother in law can help with? Maybe she can help plan the rehearsal dinner (usually the grooms parents do this anyway). Or, maybe she can help with the decorations in the wedding/reception hall. What you can do is get her involved so that she has to come and help. This is probably the easiest way for her to show that she is wanted. I hope this helps."
4518,39914,"No, I wouldn't take the test. You two are getting married because you ultimately love and trust one another. If you compromise and take this polygraph test, he's/she's basically saying he/she doesn't trust you at all. And, if he's/she's having you take a test now, what is he/she going to ask of you in the future. Remember, what happens before you get married can sometimes be 10x worst once you're in the marriage. 

Trust yourself and I think you'll do the right thing."
4615,26876,"I did them on Microsoft office and excel. What you do is on Excel create a spreadsheet with all your guest addresses make sure you have separate columns with name, street address, city, etc. Save that, then in Word, do a mail merge, and make sure your document or page layout is the correct size of the envelope you plan on using. In mail merge it will allow you to use the addresses from excel. If your not sure how to use mail merge, just send me a note here and I can give you further instructions. Like I said I did them this way, and they turned just fine, there was no need to spend money on someone doing if for me. I hope this helps."
4640,26876,"I would just wear a simple off white, gown. Not like puffy, but you know something you would wear for the evening. "
4623,26876,"In my opinion, it doesn't matter who's paying for the wedding, if your parents are going to be there include them in your invitation. I mean what if only the bride or the groom was paying for the whole thing would the invite say the groom/bride invites you to their wedding? You see where I am coming from. Anyway, as far as mom not being involved, don't worry about it, if she doesn't want to let her be. If your worring about what she will be wearing, just tell her how you feel about it, and tell that your not asking for much, your not asking her to pay for the wedding or plan it, but to be there for you at the wedding representing herself as someone who cares for you and the biggest day in your life. "
4560,26876,"There is no reason why you should be accomodating to her needs, when you have a wedding to worry about. If she eats she eats if not then its her problem not yours, so she can have whatever she thinks she can eat. I wouldn't worry about it to much and just let her know that its pretty hard to have one special course just for her, even though you said the restuarant could do it. I mean who is she...really. Sorry, that just seems so annoying to me."
4133,39765,"There are pipe bands all over that area. Some have pipers that do performances. I suggest you ask for a sound sample to be emailed to you, or check their website for audio. Please make sure you ask a prospective piper if they are a competition piper.  If they are, find out what level they are. Florida starts at grade 5 (beginner), and goes up to grade 1.  There is one more level higher, OPEN (Professional), but there aren't too many around. Grade 3 or 2 would give you a wonderful performance.  Next important issue...not all music can be played on a bagpipe. It has 9 notes. So find out if your bagpiper can play tunes you request. They should have a list of tunes they play that are commonly played at weddings.
Lastly, bagpipes are either on or off. Once they start, they are very loud and NO volume control, so keep this in mind when you decide where your piper will stand when they play.
Google search ""Pipe bands Maryland"". Talk to the Pipe Majors, they can help hook you up.  Good Luck!!"

4621,32944,"This is your wedding and there is nothing wrong with having uneven sides. The old tradition of having equal bridesmades and groomsmen should have gone out of style in the 60's with womens liberation. I have been to many weddings where the sides were uneven. I have also been to weddings where some men stood on the Brides side and some women stood on the grooms side. In my first wedding my brother was my man of honor, he fixed my dress, held my bouquet and made the event perfect for me. I am about to get remarried for a second time and we plan on having our children stand with us. My two children will walk me down the aile and will stand next to me.

The biggest thing is booking the place for the ceremony and the reception. Do this as soon as possible, especially if you are getting married in June or July. Those months are very busy and a lot of places are already booked. Get your friends and family to help you make it happen. They can help you save money by assisting you with creating your own center pieces, pew bows, etc.; you can save a lot of money by taking these tasks on yourself. Set aside a certain amount of time each week where you will work on the wedding by planning ahead and you will be surprised at how much you can accomplish and how much money you can save yourself when it comes to the detailed items.

4254,39914,"Hold up, wait a minute! You're not even married and YET you're talking about divorce already!!! Are you contemplating that your marriage might now work, but you're still planning to walk down the aisle. Are you really sure you want to live your life with the person you're about to marry? 

Now, about the name change...if you want to keep your maiden name, there is nothing wrong with it. My mother kept her name and she didn't hypenate it all AND still kept her middle name as well. She was concerned about losing her individuality because of her business. 

The only thing you have to be concerned with about a non-hyphenated name is that people get really confused! They will not know what to do with a name that is not in a conventional style. My mother was having to constantly tell others that she had two last names and they weren't hyphenated. 

So, go with what you like...you have to live with it for the rest of your married life, right? Take care and congrats on the engagement!"
4685,39832,"I think you should definitely pull together the colors you like for a test run before you make your final decision.  You may be surprised and all the colors will look fantastic together.  We did a chocolate and blue theme.  I would think Latte and blue would look great as well.  My dress was ivory with a champagne sash and my groom wore a black tux with a vest and bow tie in champange to match my dress.  I actually picked our colors by thinking of the flowers that were in bloom during the season of our June Wedding. We had a lot of flowers and it was far more economical to select something in season than something imported. The blue hydrangeas with the vendella roses that are a vanilla color looked fantastic. Ask your florist for recommendations for that time of year.  Have fun and good luck! "
4685,39914,"You're getting married at the end of summer, but right before fall. So, the Tiffany Blue (if I can remember, it's a soft light blue) could work if you're gearing your wedding towards the summer end. The royal blue (very pretty!!!) would look nice and sophisticated if you're going more towards the fall season. Now, the latte...I've never seen that color...when I think of it, I think of brown? Is it a dark brown? If so, if you decide to go with the royal blue and latte...you have to dark colors with the champagne being the neutral color. I don't know if those two dark colors would really complement the wedding party. 

I would definitely go to David's Bridal (or another wedding store) and pick up a catalog and look at the colors in there. You might get some ideas. 

My faves for a fall wedding (which I don't see often) are a chocolate and cream, champagne or beige. And, you can always have black as an additional color. 

I hope this helps."

I am sorry that she has even opened her mouth to you.  The other poster is right on the money...she should have politely accepted and kept her mouth shut about your menu.  If she was Kosher or Vegetarian...then the restaurant would make an accomodation.  Being ""The Worst Guest Ever"" is a permanent mental condition of which I am afraid she will never recover.  Please do not let this one individual upset you any further.  Invite her to the wonderful and thoughtful event you planned and then never give her another thought.  Enjoy your day and do not let the ""Joy Suckers"" of the planet detract you from honoring the special moments you will share with the rest of your family and good friends.  Have fun and good luck!"
4251,40268,"As far as ""off the beaten path"" goes, you can check out the Sapce Coast of Florida (Melbourne area).  I have personally played many weddings on the beach, and it is beautiful here.  Good luck!"
4685,36671,"Go to David's Bridal and look at the color Serene.  It's not a light blue and it's not a navy blue.  My dress is champagne with a mocha/latte sash and I""m having serene colored bridesmaid dresses.  It looks really good together (well, at least I think it does! hahaha)"
4429,39832,"We had an instant camera and a photo book instead of a traditional guest book at our reception.  Everyone had a lot of fun taking instant photos of each other and writing really great comments under thier picture in the book they went into.  We got the camera, film and book online at Target. If this is strictly just a sit down dinner evening then I would agree with the other posters that your slide show and a few toasts are more than enough during dinner.  If you want to put some interesting pary favors on the table, like Chinese finger locks or small trinkets in Chinese take-out boxes the guests will entertain themselves.  You could also put out personalized fortune cookies with cute comments in them.  That will keep the conversation flowing.  Good luck and have fun!"
4252,39832,"Well if you are thinking about throwing some yellow in there...how about some whole and cut lemons in glass containers for the centerpieces.  Maybe you could throw some silver marbles in there for your accent color.  Cut fruit is economical and will smell lovely on your summer table.  Plus it looks like you spent more than you did.  Yellow and blue with the silver accents will look wonderful!  Check out Google for fruit centerpieces and you will get some great ideas.  Good luck and Have fun!"
4685,34747,"I'm so happy right now. I bought a wedding book and I saw the colors I want to use in the invitations. I also saw some dresses that I like.  It wasnt at David's Bridal but an online store. I know I shouldnt buy anything online though.  I may just buy one dress and chuck it up.  Just to see the quality.  I think I'm still going to Hobby Lobby though to look at colors.  

By the way, I went online and looked at the color Serene.  It is a pretty color. We have the same taste."
4252,40322,"I think that using small silver containers with blue hydrangea flowers would be very classy and affordable. There are very few flowers that have a natural blue color. Hydrangeas are gorgeous! and one flower head would fill up a small container. So this choice will be very budget friendly. White hydrangeas will look great too. or a mix of white and blue with the silver urn style container. Good Luck and if you have any more questions contact me. allthatbloomsinc@yahoo.com "
4675,38857,"It is definitely possible IF you can get the big things out of the way first: (1) Location, (2) Photographer, (3) Caterer (4) Officiant and (5) DJ (6) Dress <--- Generally in that order.  All the rest is details!

To make things easier on yourself, find a place where you can have both your ceremony AND reception, get friends, sisters, and family to help with flowers/food/decor, etc. and keep it simple!

I scheduled my own wedding in 6 months while working and going to school full time and it wasn't too bad - just make sure you get the big 6 out of the way immediately!"
4642,19507,"I found the same ostrich feather centerpieces that were previously posted on ebay for about $300.00 that is a savings of $200.00 so you may want to look into that route. I think they are absolutley amazing!!"
4675,37397,"Dear Bride,
I read your total situation and the answer to your question is ""YES.""     However, you will need to inform your groom that you MUST have his help.   Obviously, he doesn't have a clue what you about you  will be going through without help.  I hope your parents and relatives can join you as well.   Mr. Wonderful will need to give up his hunting & fishing until you both have everything worked out.   That means booking all the vendors you need to complete your wedding needs.   Shop for your gown first, and then for your bridesmaids.   Order everything as soon as possible.    Then get your reception and ceremony location established.  Hopefully, they are both located  in the same place.   It makes it easier for everyone to come to.     There is plenty of ""wedding planning how-to's""  on the internet.   Use Google to find websites on wedding planning.    You two must move quickly to get everything done on time.    He needs to get his Best Man & groomsmen to the tuxedo store."
4454,37778,"I have found that Country Springs and Olympia Resort and Spa are both great outdoor locations at really good prices."
4679,40417,"I've always heard 6 months is a proper response time. I would advise doing them along as you have showers. That way when you return from your honeymoon, all you'll have to do is write thank you notes for the gifts you received at the wedding."
4675,40417,"It's totally possible! I planned my wedding for 250 guests in 4 months and both my fiance' and I have full-time jobs. Don't sweat it. I agree that it's best if you can find one location for both ceremony and reception...we even used the same location for our rehearsal dinner. Get the big four out of the way first...location, caterer, photographer, florist. Don't shop at 4-5 different stores for your gown and bridesmaid dresses. Decide on your style and pick one. I visited one store and selected my gown in the first visit. I visted another store with a friend and selected bridesmaids dresses. Don't give yourself too many options in that department. "
4714,39625,"I think it's awesome that your being thoughtful of his religion. You could always go talk to the priest (like my fiance and I have done, I'm Maronite-catholic, and he's Latin-right catholic, we are being married in a cathedral) and the priest is going to incorporate some of the ceremony rituals from my religion. You might want to check and see if the priest in his church wouldn't mind doing so for you. They are usually flexible on things, like readings and other rituals you might have.
Good Luck!"
4429,7226,"Thanks for all your great ideas!  I like the photo guest book idea.  :)  I think a slide show of our wedding, a few hours of music, and some entertaining favors should do the trick!  "
4675,35713,"Absolutely!!! Depends on the month you want to get married. If it's from the months of May-Sept you might have a bit of a hard time getting a Saturday evening booked, but you could absolutely have a Friday Evening or Sunday Brunch type wedding. Holidays are also less expensive and usually open. You just have to be a little flexible on what you want. Also some of the better vendors might be booked in the prime months but this doesn't mean you won't be able to get a good one. 

As a side note, wedding planners are usually NOT flaky if you hire someone with good references (that you've checked). Wedding Planners have resources and connections to get you what you need faster and usually at a lower cost, regardless of how soon the wedding is. 

Your wedding day can absolutely be planned on your own, however I would look into speak with a planner for advice or direction. Or even referrals. "
4451,35713,"What sort of ideas are you looking for? Decor? Or the flow of the ceremony transitioning into the reception? I will be more than willing to help you, but need a little more information on what you need help with. I was recently married at a private B&B and had the ceremony & reception at the same place. It's def. easier and a your guests appreciate not having to travel between locations. Shoot me a message and I'll help you work through it (no charge :) )

Laura  - VOW Wedding Consulting"
4643,35713,"Your officiant will be able to tell you all that happens during the ceremony. He/She will be there for the rehearsal and they will walk you through it all. So you don't need to panic as far as the ceremony is concerned. Have you spoken to the Event Manager at your venue? They can walk you through the entire reception process. IF you have more specific questions feel free to shoot me a message and I can walk you through the events as well. You don't need to worry about what takes place, the Maitre'd will be there to make sure everything is going smoothly. Are you haveing a band or DJ? So if you want a step-by-step play on what happens get in touch with me and I'll help you. Just breath, and don't panic. It will all run really smoothly. You have the hard stuff taken care of already. Also consider going to a book store and picking up ""Getting Married"" or ""Weddings for Dummies"" I know it sounds funny, but there are soo many books out there to help you, IF you don't have a planner to. "
1258,32944,"Brilliant!!!!

I love creativity"
4675,30227,"It is very possible to plan a wedding in less than six months.  I have planned a wedding in less than six days and everything was perfect.  I have also planned a wedding for over 500 guests in as little as three months.  All it takes is a little hard work and some resources such as wedding planners.  If you want any free advice just ask.  I would rather have a bride be happy with free help than disappointed with not asking for help."
4724,30227,"Having a map included with the invitation helps.  If you are having problems with Yahoo, I suggest you try MapQuest.  If you know how to get to the venue yourself it is a good idea to take that route and make a note of places to put signs stating where to turn.  This will help the guests out.  It is also very helpful to have text directions with the full address so that guests can try to MapQuest or Yahoo Map the venue site themselves."
4714,40630,"The first thing that you need to do is talk to a catholic priest. He will be able to tell you if there is any truth to that anymore. The church is always changing some things stay the same and other ""rules"" change. The thing to remeber is that each catholic church is different. Good luck!"
4643,30227,"Planning a wedding is a big step.  I understand the frustrations that are involved.  If you need any help at all with how the ceremony should go or need any advice, please feel free to contact me.  I love to help as many brides as I can."
4725,37504,"if you are getting married in the town you guys have grown up in, you can make the drive extended and fun. give them a self guided tour of your town. like brides house she grew up in, schools churches, things like that. that would take up more time and be fun for out of town guest. "
4548,34440,"Hi there. I have just recently started in the bridal consulting business and I have never heard of this particular web site but i have heard alot of good things about David's Bridal. They always have very good promotions when you buy a wedding dress. You may find your favorite dress on that site. But other than that i am sorry if i couldnt help you. I really do hope that i helped you a little. "
4499,40628,"I was in a black and white wedding (well black and my best friends wedding dress was off-white) and it was georgeous. The pictures came out great, very graphic and she used coral flowers to add a bit of pop. An added bonus is that I have been able tow wear the bridesmaid dress to other functions as well. Whether you have them wear a gown go with a tea length - a black dress in the closet can always get used again. I would just be a little careful with the black and yellow, it can be really successful but also a little bumblebee-esque."
4714,30227,"In most cases of Catholic marriages, the couple would have to undergo Pre-Cana, which is basically marriage classes.  Since he is Catholic and you are not the best thing to do is speak with a priest.  There is a preference that either the Maid of Honor or the Best Man be Catholic as well.  The only difference between a Catholic marriage and a Protestant is the Sacraments that takes place during a mass.  Doing two ceremonies is a nice touch to his grandparents, but don't ignore the faith you were raised in to make others happy.  

As a wedding planner who was raised Irish-Italian Roman Catholic I can assure you that he will not be excommunicated if he does not marry in a Catholic church.  The Roman Catholic church has changes it's views on marriage between Catholics and non-Catholics.  What you can do is be married outdoors by a Priest who is a bit more liberal.  There is nothing wrong with getting married outdoors so you can be closer to God.  "
4549,40628,"I have read somewhere that you dont need to pay for the wedding party, but then you can't be upset if people you really want in your wedding aren't able to be there due to financial reasons. I would also say that if you want to ensure that the most important people are at your wedding you could offer to foot the bill or a portion of it for them. I would do that on the ""dl"" because you dont want offend or embarass other people. Also I came across this website in a bridal mag - www.groople.com - I havent been to it but it says that it offers reduced rates specifically for group travel. Hopefully it helps! Good luck!"
4725,35713,"Are alot of your guests traveling and staying overnight at hotels? IF so then it's fine. Most will opt to go back, relax for a little and then head over to the reception. IF however most of the guests are local and it's just a gap maybe you can find a lounge or nice coffee house here people can make a pit stop before they head over to the reception. Call in advance and give them a heads up. You can add a little note in your invitations letting people know of this location where they can relax a little. It's a bit of a long gap but if it's the only thing you have to work with then gotta be creative. "
4495,35713,"Depends on your needs really. Some brides have absolutely nothing done or idea of where they want to go, so they need a planner to hold their hand throughout the whole process. Then there are the brides that know exactly what they want but want someone there to help them execute. If you are looking for someone from start to finish (intense planning), it can run you between 15%-20% of your entire wedding budget. Then you have planners who aren't full time planners but do this as a passion and they tend to do this on a flat rate basis. For a Day of Coordinator it can run you between $600-$1000 for the day. Full Time Wedding Planner's who charge flat fees can run from $5000-$10,000. If you need more help please contact me for free advice. BEWARE OF PLANNERS WHO WORK FOR FREE. NEWBIES TO BUSINESS AND DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE. DO YOU REALLY WANT SOMEONE LIKE THAT MANAGING THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF YOUR LIFE!!! IF you want more information please feel free to contact me for advice.  "
4730,24939,"i kinda have the same problem the only difference is me and my fiance have children and we plan on including them in the wedding i don't want a whole lot of children there but all my aunts have children and i would feel bad tellin one person to bring a child and another person they can't so i really guess it depends on the age of the child and the relation .it's your wedding invite who you want
"
4731,33436," I'd get your plane tickets as soon as you can, so that cost is locked in as soon as possible. Plane ticket prices are only going to go up.
The dress you can take your time with, because you're only going to REALLY need it 2-3 months out, to account for any tailoring or alterations that need to be done. Also, ask them about the best way to send it out to Jamaica - you might feel more comfortable carrying it with you, but the shop will probably have some ideas about how to get it shipped out to you. "
4621,33436,"It looks/feels less ""quirky"" if you think about the procession and recession. The procession can be your junior bridesmaid, followed by your bridesmaid, your MOH and  then you (junior slides to fartherest position down the altar, others follow so MOH is right behind you at altar). During the recession, you and your groom go first followed by the BM coupled with the MOH and Bridesmaid, with Junior Bridesmaid behind, or BM with MOH, followed by Bridesmaid coupled with Junior Bridesmaid. Nice and orderly. 

Bottom line is, though, it's your wedding and you should do what you want. What other people think of you is none of your business. "
4730,12233,"Is your ceremony and reception held at the same location? If so, having a babysitter for say children under 12 during the ceremony only might be a good idea. That way the parents with kids will still be able to come to your event and not have to worry about leaving their children at home. Both sides will be happy. Just my opinion, hope this helps! Good luck on your event!"
2154,11774,"Having photographed weddings since 2004 and being a newlywed myself, I would highly suggest that you take some pictures before the ceremony.  However, I would wait until after to do those with you and the groom.  A good photographer will be able to do most of the pictures before (given enough time) and cruise thru those after the ceremony not to keep the guests waiting.  If you do decide to take pictures before, make sure you tell the entire wedding party what time pictures are starting.  This way you, the groom and the rest of the party will be ready.  I hope everything works out for the best.  Any other questions?  Just e-mail me.  laura@gracefulimagesphoto.com"
4735,25925,"As someone whom is  new to the business, i haven't tipped any vendors.
Persoanlly they charge a fee and this is what you pay, that's it.In case of waiters and the dj's yes. The waiters becuase you where happy with the service and the dj if the partty extended later then what was planned.Eveyone else you just pay them their flat fee.If your happy and pleased with their services then you refer them to your friends."
131,5274,"Thaks for the respons. We have decided to get married on a cruise ship(Royal Caribbean). We thought that would be easy and great fun for family and friends. I would love to hear your experiences."
4735,39832,"It is typical to tip the officiant, the coordinator, the valet and the DJ or Band.  Like you our cake came with our Hotel Package so we did not tip the Bakery.  There were so many servers in our room and the hotel had added a 19% service charge for banquets so we felt that was enough. Although we did slip the 2 supervisors that ran the room a tip.  The only vendors we did not tip was the Florist and the vendor that provided the chair and table covers.  The photographer was gone so fast we never tipped them.  After I saw their product I was glad.  Check out a few other sites to see what is most common.  Ultimately YOU will determine if the service provided is tip worthy.  Good luck and have fun!"
4735,4007,"The quickest rul of thumb is not tip tip business owners (florists, coordinators, many djs, media,) unless they go above and beyond the call of duty. In may case, its usually not cash, but maybe a nice bottle of wine or a gift card.
Limo drivers 20% of bill
Catering & wait staff: 15-20% (double check that it isn't already part of your contracted amount - some time they have both a ""service charge"" but still expect a tip - they're the same thing according to my contact at a national caterers association)
Musicians: $20-25 pp
Officiant: $100 an up (they usually let you know)"
4734,39832,"We skipped on the garter and bouquet toss.  We were an older group and it just did not seem appropriate for our crowd.  One alternative I was considering in the early stages of planning was walking around with a basket of garters to hand to the gentlemen while the groom would hand out roses to the ladies.  The idea was scrapped due to our time line.  That way eveyone gets a garter and a flower.  Maybe someone else will be able to chime in with a great idea for you.  Good luck and Have Fun!"
4560,4007,"Sounds like you've got the right solution to me! I also love your idea of splurging on the most important thing to you (and me too!) and putting you event focus there. I wish more brides would create their receptions that way!If I even make it to Ohio, what is the name of this fabulous restaurant? Even though my diet is limited, my palate is very adventurous!"
4714,14504,"Dear Engaged Couples, I was actually in this situation before; being a wedding planner of two religious couples, the catholic priest ordered the groom (who was not catholic) be baptized first before the wedding ceremony could take place. I think its a very beautiful thing for you to have considered his grandparents wishes but having a neutral place would be more appropriate. How are you expecting guests to attend two ceremonies? I think you need to concentrate on what works best for the both of you. Trying working on something that will make you happy than bend to make others happy."
4724,4007,"If you google ""wedding maps"" you' find some beautiful work out there - for a price! But at about $200 for 100 maps, I still think its money well spent. Mapquest and the like are not always accurate (I had a bride create her own invitations - messages in bottles - and maps, which look tolerable, but the map & directions were wrong!)
If you have a wedding web site, a map there would be great & it doesn't clash with your stationery like an online-created map is likely to do"
4735,14504,"Most vendors tips are referrals and a good feed back from you. Something as little as a Thank you card is placed at office doors and albums for other clients to see. This draws more customers to them and vendors are able to flaunt their businesses for a job well done."
4640,4007,"First of all, if you married the man you love it was a real wedding! Just because you couldn't afford a big party with tons of guests doesn't invalidate it. But I agree, the big poufy dress is probably not the best choice, I like the idea of an ivory silk or satin gown, too."
4623,4007,"The other gals are spot-on! I would still include you mom - even in a small way on the invitation (as in ""tanya adn matt, together with their families, request the hounour of you presence...)
You might off to buy her a new outfit in honour of the fact that she gets to see at least one of her daughters married (C'mon mom, I'm getting a new outfit. You should too!)If you take her with you dress shopping or to a fitting, she'll be in a target righ environment. 
As far as her not being invovled, don't worry - it could be a blessing in disguise - particularly if she has no style."
4738,26876,"This is something your fiance and you dad should discuss, not just you. I think what will make him flip is the fact that you have it all planned out and wait till now to tell him. There is no easy way to break the news to him, just be honest and make sure your fiance talks to him, maybe first. That way your dad will know that he isan't afraid to confront him. "
4725,26876,"Considering that you ceremony may last between an hour to 1.5 hours, that seems like a long ceremony atleast for the guests. If your having a recieving line, I would do it at the church, and maybe have some punch, and very light refreshments along with it, that should buy some more time. If there are some pictures you want to be taken with your guests, this would also be the perfect time as well. "
4560,39625,"Hey, it's Jean-Robert at Pigall's it actually made top 11 of Zagat's

4675,40741,"Your right alot of wedding planners out there are flaky.

If you want to go for the more ocean feel The Aquarium of the Pacific can host a reception, it is $2,000 so it is a little pricey. But I'm sure if you use that guide you can find something your Husband to be and yourself will love!"
4725,20535,"Hi! I agree with Christina P...this would be a great time to serve punch and finger foods WHILE...the photos are taken and then have the receiving line as you and your groom LEAVE to go to the reception...We would love to be a part of your day...we are available that day at this moment...let us know if you have questions. Whatever you do...make it special for the two of you and include your guests the best you can. I also agree with the consultants that if you want to list local coffee shops and such giving them a choice of how to spend their time. Absolutely give the shops a headsup just in case.
Enjoy YOUR day!"
4731,22715,"Do both asap!
the sooner your get ur plane tickets the cheeper
as far as the dress, it takes time to shop arpund and fine what you want, then you have to oprder the dress and wait for it to come in, then you have all your fittings. The sooner the beter!
It will make the last few months less stressful for you as well
"
4548,32944,"I know that the Bridalonlinestore has a location in Houston where I can go try on the dress I am interested in. I would check your local area to see if there is a location somewhere close to you for this vendor. I see them advertised in a lot of magazines and I have read several reviews where the clients who bought a dress from the vendor were very pleased. I also plan on purchasing my dress from this vendor, and wish you the best of luck. Unlike the below review, I have not heard good things about David's Bridal. I have not used David's Bridal, but my sister-in-law did and her experience was not so great. Perhaps, it depends on the store and the manager."
4738,32944,"There is no easy way to tell your parents, especially since you are only 18. If your Dad freaks out on you I would ask him why he does not approve. I also got married very young and I am now divorced. I know that you are in love and believe that divorce will never happen to you, but your father may have concerns as a result of his own personal experiences. Respect him and have your fiance ask him for his permission to marry you. You are his baby girl and in his mind he may not be ready to see you all grown up. He may also be concerned that you will end up miserable and alone, just like he may be. Good luck and I wish you the best."
4723,11774,"I noticed that you are looking for a photographer.  I am located in NC but have traveled to northern VA for a wedding.  I do have a fellow photographer that helps when a couple asks or is needed.  Some work is on my website and I can give you a password to my portfolio.  I'm sure that I can compete with local photographers prices and meet all your needs.  If you would like to know more just e-mail me.  laura@gracefulimagesphoto.com   I wish you all the best in your upcoming wedding and hopfully many years of marriage."

4520,40899,"I am dedicating songs to people throughout the night.  I will play my mom and dad's song, a song dedicated to the maid of honor, my brother etc...  I will thank that person for being there and say a little something special about why te song reminds me of them."
4730,40945,"I'm not crazy about there being a lot of kids either...We don't want the number to get too high and it's ridiculous if you have so many family members and friends with kids...it adds up when you're constantly having to invite families of 4, 5, 6, and so on...So I think we are going to cut it down to only family and anyone on the groom's side traveling from France-obviously we couldn't expect them to leave their kids at home! But you shouldn't have to invite friends' and coworkers' kids. I think that's a fair compromise!"
4679,22715,"The ""old fashion"" English rule of thumb is you have up until 1 year. 
However in todays world with the craziness of everyday life I say do them asap. 
If you have a shower try to get them out before the wedding day. Once married try to get them done in a few weeks after your honeymoon. 
If it put it off to long, time will pass, you will forget who gave you what, and the thank you""s may not have the same heartfelt appeal to them!"

4765,40388,"20 years in this bussiness and I would suggest asking your fiance what he would like. With this being your third, share his exspectations. It's still okay to wear white, althought there are alot of colored wedding dresses this season. You want to be comfortable with what you and your wedding party are wearing and that will show with your guest and make them comforatable and relaxed as well.

With the ceremony being small, I don't forsee any problems being tacky or offensive. Good Luck, Terilyn Howell"
4373,40388,"I will be at the Queen Mary show. First Congregational church. Its a few blocks from the Queen mary. We have a Hall that can accomadate  up to 250 guest.

After the bride/groom, bride/father, groom/mother dance, I start off with Bob Siclar's - Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now).  The beginning allows for the DJ to announce the dance floor is open to all at the beginning of the song  then it kicks.  Check that out.  If you have further questions, e-mail me at g_the_dj@hotmail.com.

Oh, Congrats on the wedding!"

1933,39503,"I got married in September 2007 in the Santa Cruz Mountains in California.   All wedding attire was recycled.  The girls dresses (including mine) were second hand.  The guys tuxedos were rented (easy).  All food served was organic.  Wines were from local winery.  Flowers were organic and locally grown, then arranged by a friend.  Invitations were created and printed by us on recycled paper.  We were married outdoors so decorations and other throw aways were minimal.  We left the wedding in a pedi-cab.  As our wedding was held under the towering redwoods, the last page of our program provided information about the Save the Redwoods League.

4723,9433,"I am using After the Flash for my wedding on memorial day weekend. The photographer's name is Brian Hebb. The engagement pictures he took were really good, he put me at ease (which is not easy since I HATE having my picture taken)and was very personable. I don't feel like I photograph well but he got me to smileand positioned us in poses that looked natural. I know you said you wanted 2 photographers but I don't recommend it because they will tend to get in the way, you will pay more for them and your guests will take more than enough extra pictures for you. A good photographer will get the good shots from the right angles. Brian also has a neat payment system unlike anyone else. As much as I hate having my picture taken he is the vendor I feel totally confident about as my wedding approaches. P.S The only downside is that he took a little while to get the pictures back to us but I am sure you could fix that by setting expectations!"
4770,41179,"I would check for little surprises like corking fees (per bottle fees that a venue charges if you bring your own wine) and service providers that they will only allow. A venue may only let you use preferred service providers that they work with and these services can be very expensive. A fair venue will have recommendations but will allow you to choose what you service providers that you like and are reasonably priced. Also get everything in writing. Times for decorating, clean up time, cleaning fees, misc fees, and anything that is a concern to you that you can think of. Read the contacts before you sign very carefully and try to find people that have used the facility before you to find potential problems. Also ask if there is anybody using the venue before you or after you. This may have an effect your special day as some venues become greedy and book things too tight. Hope this helps. "

4765,4007,"I love new beginnings! I say make your last wedding your favorite wedding. AND I agree with the other poster - make sure its his last, best wedding, too. Unless he wants all the traditional elements, I would recommend keeping a tightly focused theme (like the gourmet bride on this site whose reception is a 7 course feast, or the one who loves travel & is having a travel themed event.)"
4773,4007,"Have you looked in nearby Temecula? There are wineries there that are lovely: http://www.temeculawines.org/locations.asp. For flowers, I would call Caty at Resplendent (760-715-0343) - she's worked at serveral venues out that way & is amazing."
4770,4007,"Besides unreasonable corkage fees, I would look for cake cutting charges, and whether or not they charge BOTH gratuity and a service charge (which are really the same thing, unless they can explaain a rational difference.)Also, will they put out any special decor for you such as chair covers (what price?) do they charge to re-set the space from ceremony to reception. There is so much to consider that I use a two page questionnaire! One important one would be whether or not they plan on doing any remodeling - I installed a canopy ceiling at a remote venue that had a dark ceiling so I used dark electrical equipment to make it less visible. Without any prior notice, they painted the ceiling, making my dark equipment stand out. (I was able to come up with light colored cords, but it wasn't a fun last minute scramble!"
4559,445,"Some great ones my brides who have used are Dave Orlando, Don and Rick.

4766,4007,"I have also used them, and was quite happy with who we used, but unfortunately, they were wiped out with the 2005 storm season. I use a grower in CA (wholesale only, sorry) who I order from online and they ship right to me. Even with shipping, their prices are better than the local wholesaler.
So, yes I'd try it, but watch out for shipping methods and pricing. For example, www.freshroses.com cold ships its prodcuts, but their shipping prices are certainly more. Make sure whoever you use ships overnight early delivery service - and get them early enough for you to make last minute substitutions if there has been damage (even the best ones have occasional damage.)Also, check their damaged goods policy."

4352,4007,"The proper way to give gifts to the happy couple has always been to have them sent to the bride's home NOT to bring them to the wedding, although people are always doing this. Often when people bring gifts to a ceremony site and ask me where the gift table is, I politely mention that most gifts have been sent to their home, but if they would like to bring them to (whatever person has been designated to transport gifts) at the receptio, that person will make sure they get to the couple's new home.
A registry card is never appropriate to place in a wedding invitation, but a card in the invitation or notation on the program with the couples new address is always appropriate."

4796,32944,"I have not used these types of invitations; however, I suggest you put the most important information on the invitation (Names, date, time and place) then enclose the directions/map separately. You can print the maps yourself to look like a concert flyer, which will enhance the whole idea. Congradulations and good luck!"
4786,32944,"White is the cheapest and most common form of table cloth used at a wedding reception. You can keep it simple and elegant by using the white table cloth and adding accents of black and candy apple red. You can have black place mats, red napkins and a red center piece. If you are planning on covering your reception chairs then combine the black and red ribbon to make your chair bows and you can always add some pretty red beads to the end of the black ribbon as well. Cristmas just ended and valentine's is right around the corner so a lot of stores have red ribbon, vases, etc. on clearance or on sale. You might be able to find something to use as a center piece or additional items to pull all of the colors together. "

I think all are very creative...good luck!"
4811,737,"Are there any other roles they can play in the wedding?  Are you going to have a reading, special music, or anything like that?  Perhaps they can take on those roles and still participate in the ceremony itself!"
4802,26876,"Many supersticious people would say its bad luck. I say blah blah blah, If you want to tweak it up go for it. Why spend more money when you have a dress already. I wish I could find more use for my wedding gown, but unfortunately its just there in my closet. I say go for it!"
4811,26876,"If the other two are 18 and 15, why can't they be bridesmaids too? "
4798,26876,"The only way you can change your name is if you have a marriage certificate, so no you can't have your new name before you get married. As far as having a passport with your maiden name on it, it shouldn't be a problem. I had the same problem, but I figured its not like I travel a whole lot anyway, so my passport has my maiden name on it still. And, if you still want to have your new name on your passport aterwards, you can always do that. "
4813,26876,"Well to be honest with you, regardless of what books may say, your Maid of Honor does not HAVE to help you with anything. Its great if they do, but I would not expect them to assume responsibilities that books say. So the fact that she doesn't help with anything, shouldn't be reason to demote her. The fact that she shows no interest or acts indifferent towards you would be a good reason. I would just talk to her and tell her how you feel, and take it from there.  Or if you really want her to get involved, but one of those books from B&N or borders that tell what a Maid of Honor should do. "
4243,16821,"Thank you for all of your suggestions. I really want to use ivory roses and candles eveywhere! "
4725,17716,"We thought we were going to have the same problem with our wedding arrangement, but several people have told me they'll figure out some way to pass time.  They won't miss your reception for the world, so don't worry about it.  We're opening our reception hall for drinks only so if anyone shows up early, they'll at least be able to hang out.  

The biggest concern I've encountered is the photographer.  Most want to book for no more than 8 hours, and if you're going to get pictures before, during and after the ceremony, and then the reception, it gets tight on time. It's even more of a hassle if there's considerable travel time. Just keep this in mind."
4679,17716,"I agree with some of the earlier comments.  I think you should complete the thank you's from all of your showers ASAP.  After the wedding, try to complete your thank you's within 45 days of returning from your honeymoon.  Your friends and family will really be very impressed and you'll be relieved of the responsibility.  "
4502,17716,"I like to stick with a $50 money gift, or something off the registry about that much.  If it's close family or a dear friend, then the amount can go up from there.  A friend of mine has recommended estimating what you think the dinner cost would be and providing a gift close to that estimated amount.  "
4642,24657,"I found this website www.backdropsfantastic.com
They have at least 2 Hollywood themed backdrops. You can rent them for $500 to $800 for a week. They have discounts available also, maybe not for the backdrop you decide on though. But it is worth a shot.
Good Luck!"
4714,38186,"It is loving of you to want to accommodate his grandparents. I'm not clear on whether being married in the church truly matters to him. I'm also wondering whether the two ceremonies idea is one that pleases you both. I have married couples who do two ceremonies: one for the parents, one for them (not that they didn't also enjoy the one for the parents!). I agree that it would be a good idea to find out whether Catholic law stipulates what the grandparents suggest or whether this is a scare tactic. I would suggest exploring the kind of ceremony you and your fiance want. There are several issues here, but the most important one is to find a way to create a ceremony that will express what is most sacred in your relationship. You may need two ceremonies to accomplish this and accommodate family wishes as well. It looks like you have a bit of time to figure this out. I wish you peace, wisdom and courage as you plan your ceremony."
4685,19373,"Since blue comes in so many shades you have options. Latte and champagne are more of your mid-colors(not dark or light) so why not try a mid-shade of the blue like sky or baby. Those might be a little softer to bring out your champagne and latte, unless you want that bold look. I want to add a thank you; you are getting married on my birthday. Anyway have you though about hiring a professional? They can help with these types of things so you don't have to. Where are you getting married?"
4829,4007,"If you're Catholic, the Chapel of the North American Martyrs at Jesuit High School in New Orleans is beautiful. I stepped in at the last second to help with a family wedding there this fall & it was just beautiful & they seemed very easy to work with.
The reception was at the Wyndam canal place - good food, pretty common areas, good service in the public spaces, but the rooms were mismatched, missing things like blinds & bath towels etc, and took most of the day to get cleaned.
The rehearsal dinner was at the Bourbon Vieux upstairs room on Bourbon street, which seemed adequate, if a little kitschy. We skipped dinner there, so I can't comment on the food. Instead we ate at Stella! in the French Quarter - amazing - one of the best meals I've ever had.
Anyway, I hope that gives you some help."
4811,4007,"I saw an article where the attendants were all young and young-ish children. There were no other adults besides the bride, groom, and officiant. It was charming, not to mention finding dresses was much easier! I can't think of a better way to start you marriage than surrounded by your immediate family."
4735,40622,"My planner said not to tip.  The tip is included in your catering bill ussually under a ""service charge"".  We tipped our DJ because he was AMAZING and we also tipped our venue coordinator and day of wedding planner.  But we didn't have to."
4759,35247,"Hi, this is Scott, I proposed in Cancun. We had a great time down there. We stayed at the Royal Cancun, on the hotel strip. It is a beautiful all-inclusive resort. It opened Febuary 2007. The sevice was great and so were the restaurants. Everyone was so friendly and willing to help you. They will also do your wedding there if that is what you are looking for. Mayan Riviera has nice resorts but there is not much of a town around it. No matter were you go down there take a trip to Xel-Ha, it is a beautiful natural water park with tubing dwon the river or snorkling. Also, from Cancun you can take the ferry to Isla Mujeres, which is a little island that is just north of Cancun. You get a chance to haggle over little souveniers. Congrats on the engagement, have fun with the planning"
4675,30547,"Absolutely! Everyone who has responded has great advice, but one thing you should also look into is how involved is the caterer? From a catering standpoint, you should find a company that will help you plan for details such as table settings, timeline, and vendor and site recommendation. I have planned weddings with just a few weeks' notice, and I know it has been a great relief to the bride to have such an involved caterer.

4730,30547,"I have done several weddings with children and haven't really seen any major issues with having children attend. I think it really depends on what kind of feel you want for the reception - is it very formal? I second Tanya and Matt's idea of employing a babysitter during the ceremony. You can't expect them to sit still the entire time, and you wouldn't want to be interrupted. For the reception, however, you could have a children's table that you could put towards the corner. Have coloring books, paper, and small games that will keep them occupied, and order them kids meals from the caterer such as chicken fingers or miniature pizzas. If your reception is at an outdoor venue, it is even easier as most kids will be running around. Just make sure you specify in the invitation whether it is a kid-friendly reception so parents can act accordingly. 

Best of luck to you,

4844,6464,"You could do a type of candle lighting ceremony that begins the ceremony where they each light a candle - each candle being lit from the other.  One candle for those who have passed, then the next candle lit for your friends, and the last candle lit for family.  Then someone can light your ""bachelor"" candles from the family candle.  Then you guys use those to light your unity candle.  The symbolism is how everyone in your lives have touched you and helped to bring you such an important day together.

Or you could ask them to do a reading of a spiritual verse.  Or, have each of them read a portion of the ""hands"" poem rather than the officiate.  It's a really touching way to have it done and to incorporate family. If you're unfamiliar with the poem let me know and I'll post it.

Good luck! :)

4848,6464,"Your simplest and least stressful answer might be to just let them all pick out their own gown within those colors that you've chosen.  Then have your bridesmaids have the same bouquet, and the MOH's bouquet with a extra touch to it - either more colorful, bigger, carry a shawl in addition, etc.  If you have them all do the same hairstyle have the MOH with something slightly different.

4770,6464,"When you visit the venue plan out where you want the DJ/Band, cake table, gifts, head table, food table, dance floor, etc and make sure there's room.  Also, take a look at the lighting and color of the room.  Very dark painted walls and ceilings will mean your photos will be more flash heavy.  Also, make sure they will keep some of the house lights part way up during the reception - hopefully they have faders so it's just not on or off.  If it's almost completely dark your photographer & videographer will have a struggle getting cameras to focus.  You don't want to rely just off of the DJ's lights.  Keep in mind that having the lights up at least part way will help make sure your images that you keep for the next 50 years will be gorgeous!

Good luck & Have Fun!

4849,39625,"Make sure to give them plenty of time to figure out accommodations. My fiance and I are making welcome boxes, just things our guest might have forgotten on their long travel, tissues, water, snacks, I even got Chanel to donate samples of body wash and perfumes for the women..I always forget both on trips.

4760,21017,"Hi Jodie
Congratulations to you/your fiance and best wishes!
I'm a pro DJ in NH and some of the bridal party dance songs that I've suggested & couples used have been:

""Thank You""- Dido
""Friends in Low Places""- Garth Brooks
""We are Family""- Sister Sledge
""Celebration""- Kool & the Gang or ""Goodtimes""

If your bridal party dance follows your other formal dances, your DJ
is getting ready to open the dance floor for you/your guests- A great song that will break the ice- ""Mustang Sally""- Wilson Pickett

Good luck!

4834,38902,"I know what you mean...I live in Washington and the majority of my family lives in California. I wouldn't stress too much about making travel as easy as possible for everybody because it is YOUR special day and your family will want to enjoy it with you no matter where you choose to hold it. Just make sure that YOU are happy with the location. 

Hope that helps!"
4811,30227,"You can always have his 18 year old as your co-maid of honor and then make the two 15 year olds junior bridesmaids.  If you have too many young bridesmaids it does not matter.  What truly matters is that all the children are involved in the wedding since you will all be family.  You can also have the older girls do readings during the ceremony and have a special part in ceremony for the kids by presenting them with the ""family medallion"".  It is a great way to have all the kids involved with the wedding so no one feels left out or excluded on this special day for all of you."
4623,30227,"The best thing you can do is sit down and talk with your mom.  She may not be too happy about this wedding because you are the last of her daughters to be married and she is seeing an end as her role of a parent.  Go out to lunch with her and talk it over.  Then go shopping for a dress for her to wear to the wedding.  If she balks gently explain that since this is a special day for you and your fiancee, that you want your mom to look her best on that day.  

As for the invitations, I would include your parents if you are including his.  You do not want to start things off on the wrong foot with both sets of parents.  But, do sit down with mom and talk to her.  You can let her know how much her non-participation hurts you and that you really want her to be a part of the planning process."
4848,42514,"I also was having issues with picking my colors and finally settled for chocolate brown, ivory and gold. My MOH is wearing a champagne/ivory color dress and the other BM's are wearing the brown. I was worried because she is spanish and has light skin but tans very well in the summer so we should be good to go. I was able to find the dress I wanted for them on line at Nordstrom but it only came in pink and baby blue so I'm having them made by a seamstress. You should try Macy's, Nordstrom and Talbot's women section, they have very beautiful dresses for the full figure ladies that are very classy and elegent. Good luck and best wishes!"

4853,10165,"Create a theme for your wedding, such as Romantic Candlelight -- lots of candles with red roses and petal everywhere, add Christmas lights to help with the glow, lots of tulle for a cloudy feel;  OR a theme of Fairytale Love -- use tulle again for the cloudy look and then add your ribbons of your colors, for the ceremony create an area with an arch and lots of greenery and your flower choice, come to the wedding site in a carriage and look for a gown with a Cinderella look, have a young man dressed in a tux bring a glass slipper into the wedding ceremony - your husband-to-be take the slipper and try it on your foot(this can be where the officiant pronounces you husband & wife and then kiss); other themes like Country, Love in the Garden, Butterfly Beauty, Love by the Sea, the Love Story, etc.

Good luck and have fun!!  You can do these cheaply, too, if you think and ask for ideas from others!!  Email me for more ideas and tips!

3868,36654,"You might try the Karmina Palace in Manzanillo.  Its beautiful, and definitely not a spring breakers destination.  here is the web address.  
http://www.barcelokarminapalace.com/"
4560,42748,"Wow! It is YOUR wedding! Don't let that crazy woman take any of that away from you. You are the bride and you should make the decisions. I would politely tell her that I would see what I can do, but can't guarentee anything and that your sorry. Don't let her have power over you. This is your big day! 
I'm pretty blunt, if it were me, I would tell her just not to come haha but that's just me.
Good luck with everything, don't let that power tripped idiot steal your thunder!!!"
4858,14339,"The situation you described is fairly common... yet difficult. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable on your wedding day.

If you are close friends with specific co-workers, I would suggest that you invite those people. The reception dance or event after your ceremony would be an appropriate place to invite the remainder of your co-workers and boss. This can often be done through an informal invitation posted in your workplace."
4352,14339,"Any reference to a gift on your invitation goes against traditional etiquette and is frowned upon. With a destination wedding such as yours, most guests will have purchased their own airfare and accomodations and may see your gift request as inappropriate. I would suggest talking to friends and relatives about the situation and have them help get the word out.

My guess is that most people will realize the dilema in your situation when they try to pack a wedding gift in their luggage. :) You may end up with some wrapped gifts at your wedding, but your hotel should be able to arrange shipment of them to your husband-to-be's parents.

Hope this helps, and congratulations on your upcomming marriage!"
4204,14339,"As many people have already stated, the etiquettly correct way to handle this situation is in how you address the envelopes. That being said, I have seen many people use the words ""adult only reception"" at the bottom of their invitation or on their reception cards. If you choose to go this route, make sure that the text is small and appropriate. Be aware that by doing this there may be guests that you would have liked to share your day with missing from your wedding due to not being able to find childcare. For this reason, paying for an onsite (or in hotel) babysitting service is a great idea. "
4560,39625,"So she's officially the WORST PERSON/GUEST in the world. I had gotten the manager to write an email explaining why they couldn't accomodate her, and I sent it to her with a  note from me. And he clearly says if you are not eating, don't come. So I told her we would just see her at around 9-10 for dessert and champagne..and she insisted she was still coming. So I got angry and finally just said no you aren't coming to the dinner we will see you later. So as childish as she is, she got her husband involved. And, the BEST PART, is they actually tried to give me an ultimatum - if she wasn't going then neither was he. I just laughed and said they would be missed but they can always join us later. He had the nerve to email my fiance and ask him if he knew about anything I was saying, of course he did..so they got even more upset. Oh well. It's my day, and I'm tired of her being so jealous about everything involving me!"
4858,18635,"This is a really hard situation.  I'm dealing with this myself.  I do disagree with the previous poster.  Why invite peopel to your reception and not the ceremony?  That really doesn't make much sense.  In addition, as adults we all know that we are closer to some co workers than others.  Now you can't go and invite a bunch of other supervisors and not your own or all of a certain department except 1 or 2.  That is the kind of thing that you really need to be mindful about.  I would also be a bit discreet about who you are and aren't inviting.  I would even consider talking with the few individuals that I was inviting about not being so open as well.  

Hope this helps"
4451,14339,"I attended a beautiful wedding at a bed and breakfast a few years ago that had a similar issue as yours. They were married outside but both the dinner and dance were to take place inside the house. As there was not enough room to have both set up, they needed to find a way to have the guests leave after the dinner and return when the dancefloor and reception tables had been set up. They solved this problem by setting up a small covered location outside that served drinks and hordevours while the staff converted dinner location. It was seamless and the guests actually enjoyed the quiet time to mingle with others before the dance began."
4844,42831,"A wedding is about 2 families merging together.  I would think it would be very important for you fiance's sister's to be able to gather around him in support.  If they were male they would be groomsmen right? I think that you should really ask them to be your bridesmaids, or maybe they could walk your fiance down the aisle.  I imagine the ceremony is going to be emotionally happy and sad, what a better way to recognize and embrace your new family by fully including them in the wedding?"
4559,30968,"I no one that I have worked with as I am a photographer and my wife a wedding planner. She uses him most of the time because of his rates, which are almost half the price you are talking: also he keeps the growd busy on the dance floor. His number is 443-278-6212. His business is DJ Extraordinair.
Hope that helps

4853,41544,"I am looking for more like a romantic type feel. thank u veilmaker you are a lifesaver...theme is kind of hard for me because I like alot of stuff... LOL.. my color's are candy apple, white... black with silver accents. so if anybody have any ideas please let me know."
4813,42791,"Hi Catherine! Im sorry youre going through such a stressful time. Although talking to someone about how you feel and searching for a common ground is a fabulous breakthrough, sometimes I understand its easier said than done. So, another few ideas are to have two maids of honor (MOH), honor a friend or family member as a matron of honor (a lot of times has more responsibilities than the MOH), or more and more brides and grooms are asking close friends of the opposite sex to be their honored guests. If you feel the relationship may be hindered if your soon-to-be sister-in-law doesnt have any duties to fulfill, talk with her about what she would like or can do. Maybe light a candle, hold your bouquet or read a poem. Hope this helps!"
4362,42791,"The timing is entirely up to you. Whenever you decide to have the wedding reception, I would recommend incorporating pieces of your wedding (colors, pictures) in its decor. It would also be a nice touch sending out formal invitations to everyone. Using these ideas can help people feel like they were a part of your special day without the flight. Hope this helps! "
4853,39503,"You have 5 weeks to get everything ready.  I'm sure if you ask specific questions, we'd be able to help you.  The wedding is close to Valentine's Day so you can always play off that. Are you getting married indoors or outdoors, in a church or where?  Do you need help with flowers, favors, wedding ceremony, reception, invitations, or ...? Give more details and you'll get more than you'll know what to do with!  Good luck!"
4601,42791,"Congratulations! For a 'less is more' budget, I highly recommend considering beautiful state or county parks and historical town squares for a garden-like setting. Many of these places will let you use them for a nominal fee or free! This has been very popular amongst our brides and so much fun planning. Please e-mail me if you are interested in our services. Wish you the best! "
4856,39503,"Our friends and family decorated our cabin with things from the wedding.  Of course, there were all the flowers.  We had a table with wedding photos of several generations from both families set up at the wedding, so they were set up in our cabin.  There was a gift table and the basket of notes everyone had written us.  The fridge was stocked with wine, food and cake from the wedding - including ""to go"" from the caterer.  That was a lifesaver because I don't think I ate more than a bite at the reception.  And then there were the flower petals all over the bed and all the candles lit.  Very simple, very romantic and sincere. "
4883,39503,"Although I didn't use the online store you've mentioned.  I did buy my dress and my flower girl's dress on eBay and I bought the bridesmaids' dresses on FreeWeddingClassifieds.com.  In each case, I emailed and talked by phone to the sellers, got the exact measurements of the dresses and more details, and went from there.  My bridemaids went to a local store to try on the dress I'd selected to see how they'd looked and felt in it.  I purchased everything and had it shipped.  Everything fit everyone perfectly, no alterations were needed.  I save a lot of money and felt like I was doing the right thing by recycling these dresses - and they were all beautiful.  Take a look a peak at my wedding photos to see if you agree.  "
4898,39503,"Your count depends on what you need it for.  For seats, you'll need to know how many bottoms expect to sit.  For food, you need to know how many mouths will be eating.  For drinks (alcohol and non), you'll have to have an idea of how mouths will be drinking.  Get the idea?  If you are having a served reception dinner, you may have a children's plate and an adult plate - but when it comes to cake, they'll all dig in.  "
4493,39503,"You are so right!  As all of our guests traveled to be with us for our wedding, we had three days of events - plenty to get frazzled about.  My mantra when I would feel tense was that everything that anyone did was with the best intentions. On my wedding day, as each person arrived in the bridal room, I repeated that to them to keep them from stressing out.  It worked.  We had a fabulous day and the laughter and love shows in all the photos and videos. I wish every bride and groom could enjoy their day as much as we did."
4730,42791,"Well, the type of reception is a huge factor. Is it an open bar? nightclub, party, or family atmosphere? outdoors where the children can play more freely? My word of caution would be that this may be an emotional issue with some of those invited. Also, you may find yourself giving in to some that call upset or feel that they have the right to bring their children b/c they're family. The solution brought out in the other comments about having a sitter would be a great compromise. Hope this helps!"
4893,30237,"I can recommend this company for fun supplies for your night out!

4548,42934,"I also checked out this website and didn't end up going with the dress that I had originally found; however, it seems that they have a good return policy should you not like the dress after you get it. If you are concerned about the prices of the dresses you may be surprised at what you can find in the little boutiques. I found mine there and it was just over the prices that they had on their website and I was able to try on a few to see which one I liked better. Also, I don't think I would recommend going to David's Bridal. They do have good prices; however, they lack in customer service. Good Luck! :)"
4895,26876,"Start with a guest list. You'll go over you guest list so many times its not even funny. Find a venue, decide on a theme or colors. Maybe find a planner, you only have 6mos. to plan and you need all the help you need. "
4897,39914,"First, establish a budget for the wedding. How much can you afford for the wedding AND reception? Once you determine that, then it might be good for you to hire a wedding event planner. A good planner will listen to you in regards to your wants and needs. All in all, they will help you through the whole process, which takes a lot of worry off of your back. However, if you want to plan the wedding without a planner, you can do it...but you might impose lots of stress on yourself. If you do it, visit the bookstore and get a wedding planner guide. A good one is ""Easy Wedding Planning Plus."" You can give a bookstore representative the ISBN number to find the book for you. It's 1-887169-36-9. 

I hope this helps! I planned my own wedding and it turned out great...but I was sooo stressed!"
4556,39503,"Find an officiant that will work with you in writing a ceremony that reflects you and your groom.  There are also books available that help too.  It can be overwhelming if you try to look at all the possibilities. I found ""The Knot's Guide to Wedding Vows and Traditions"" very helpful.  I just checked and used copies are available at Amazon.com for like $3 - well worth it!  "
4858,39503,"Your wedding is a very personal occasion.  Invite those who are part of your personal life, not just work or professional life.  If you wouldn't consider inviting this person to your home for dinner or vice versa, don't feel that you have to invite them to your wedding. You may save them from being in the uncomfortable position of turning down an unwanted/unexpected invitation or attending when they really don't want to.  

And another point is that everyone understands the expense of a wedding.  One of the main factors of that expense is food.  So no one expects a couple to invite everyone they know, the guest list has to be managed to keep the budget in line."
4768,39503,"I too have long (mid-back) baby fine hair.  So I completely understand your dilemma.  I played with all sorts of beautiful hair styles that looked great, but chose to go with something that I knew would last all day without any problems.  My bridesmaids put it into a simple french twist.  They used lots of bobby pins and 3 coats of the hairspray.  My hair is dark brown, so we added these little rhinestone florets (sort of coordinated with the beading on my dress) where the hair twisted into the back of my head.  The floret is at the end of a little spiral that twists into the hair - I bought those at Claire's Icing at the mall.  My hair is super slippery (you have fine hairs, so I'm guessing you know exactly what I mean) and the twists stayed in all day - something I worried about with any thing in my hair.  We fixed my hair at about 10am and it still looked good when I took it down at 8 that night.  So stick with something tried and true for you hair - there's enough to worry about."
4792,39503,"Men's Warehouse! I'm not in your area, but I think they are nationwide.  They were awesome to work with.  My groom and I met with the consultants here in Sacramento to pick everything.  His best man went to the store in his city for fitting and to pick up.  Then they allowed us to return the tuxes to the store in the city where we were married.  Plus, it is a package deal - your guys will get everything they need to look perfect for one set price.  Bonus plus, the staff were personable and friendly."
4844,39503,"I had a similar situation.  We were very conscientious about our wedding being about bringing two extended families together (both my parents are deceased and his father is deceased), not just about bringing the two of us together.  I knew who I wanted as bridesmaids and went with that.  Then I talked with his sisters explaining that I wanted this to be about family and asked them how they would like to participate.  I was thrilled that one wanted to do the flowers and decoration.  The other simply said she would be honored to do whatever I wanted.  I asked her to do a reading.  Each got to do something they were comfortable with and enjoyed.  And I made sure that they were recognized for their participation both in the wedding program and by giving them a gift along with the bridesmaids and flower girl.  "
4802,39503,"I agree with Christine.  Its important to stay in budget so you start your married life stressed by wedding debt, so economical is good.  Its important that you feel beautiful and it sounds like this fits the bill.  I suggest checking with your fiance to make it doesn't make him feel awkward, but my guess is that he's a guy and it won't bother him a bit.  Its your day, you can do whatever you want!"
4470,39503,"My flower girl's head piece was made from a flower called Misty Blue (common name) which is a type of statice.  It comes in a few pale colors, we used the purplish-blue.  It was perfect.  I have photos online and could easily share them with you, if you're interested.

"
4549,39503,"You aren't expected to pay travel expenses for your bridal party.  You can contact airlines and hotels to arrange discounts for your bridal party and guests.  The airlines are simple, just takes a phone call.  All the information is on their websites, just look for the meeting discounts or something along those lines.  I just did this with Continental - the discounts are on a sliding scale and can be as much as 18%.  Took me 10 minutes to arrange.  No one expects you to do it, but if you have the time they will appreciate it."
4497,39503,"I'd say the budget would dictate the number of guests on your guest list.  If budget is not a concern, then let people sit where they want.  We reserved seats for those extra special members of the family and the rest were open.  It worked perfectly."
4897,21407,"First and foremost is, choose your date and book the venue of your choice for that date taking into consideration the number of guests you will be inviting . Venues are booked a year or more in advance so make sure you have that first.  Your final menu, dress, bridesmaids, florals, decor can all be decided later. The earlier you get things done, the fewer the disappointments you will have if any.  At one time you could wait to book your florist and decorator, but nowadays they are booked 6 months to a year in advance as well. I have bookings into 2010 at present. When you get these things done early, you can relax a bit more, and concentrate on the little things closer to the wedding date. "
4914,26876,"Well normally the father of the bride is escorted and escorting, by you. The father of the groom walkis in with the mother of the groom if still together. Other wise he may just walk in."
4917,39625,"I would just tell her, that when you started wedding planning, you didn't realize you wanted to have a more intimate wedding. Meaning very close friends, and family. I'm sure she'll understand."
4893,20060,"I own a Bridal Shop and we specialize in doing bachelorette parties with lingerie.  We bring in lingerie for the guests at the party to get for the bride to be for her honeymoon night/week, if going away.
We also have lotions and oils.  The guests can purchase things also.  We have also incorporated certain lessons and topics to talk about depending on what the party would like.

Good Luck!!

Making Your Event Special"
4813,42514,"One of the many reason I didn't use any family memebers from both side to be my MOH or BM's. I have five sisters and he has two and I have only my friends(4 girlfreinds)standing up with and for me. My siblings have their own issues and I be damn if they stress me out. I'm so glad with making the choice, my girls are doing a great job and I couldn't ask for a better set of ladies. As for you I would drop her like a hot cake! You really need someone that is going to step up and assist you with everything. I didn't realize how time consuming some of the task/projects can be and my MOH has a small son and works two jobs and she makes the time to take me every where. She is more committed to me then my fiancee and it his wedding too. Your time is ticking and you need to replace her ASAP! Congratulations and best of luck."
4796,43176,"A friend of mine created their own invites to look like tickets to a sporting event. They did it on paper that folds into itself to make an envelope this way they could add an insert to it with the directions, map and such."
4852,39625,"I'm not sure of how far or close you are to a SAKS, or what your budget is, but I went their for my wedding dress. And the people their were amazing, I just called - made an appointment, and they asked if I had a budget, so that they could help me choose dresses that would fit the budget. I had a great time!"

4251,6001,"My husband and I married in Outer Banks, North Carolina.  We rented a huge beautiful house on the beach in Corolla.  Everyone stayed at the house and arrived on Friday, we married Saturday afternoon and they left Sunday we stayed an extra week.  We married on Dec. 7 in 70 degree weather on the beach.  

My cousin married on the beach late last Oct. in Kill Devils Hill.  Her house slept 20-25 ppl.  Family and friends who traveled (apx. 150) rented houses next to or within walking distance and did the group thing.

Have fun!  And Congratulations!"
4802,43145,"My first initial reaction was no way! But since you're going to tweak it, then I think that might work. It would be a great save to use it, but make sure it is special for this wedding, that it wont remind you of your first. I agree with Karen, talk to you fiance and if he is okay with it, then go for it."
4675,43145,"6 months is plenty of time. I had 3 months to the day to plan my wedding for 150. My husband proposed on April 22, 2006 and we were married on July 22, 2006. We were in a similar situation, it was either get married then or wait a whole year. Honestly, God was the one that put everything together, putting me in the right place at the right time. Prayer works! All I used to know if I had everything together was ""The Bride's Book of Lists - Things to Do & Questions to Ask"" by Amy Nebens. My best friend gave it to me the day I got engaged 'cause she was in on the proposal. My Mom did most of the planning for me. She is very creative and went with a sea/beach theme since my husband proposed on the shore, and I chose Pool Blue at David's Bridal for my bridesmaids dresses. I chose the color and each girl chose a different dress, I wanted them to be comfortable, and it took away from time of trying to find the perfect dress that would fit all of them.

Feel free to ask me any questions!"
4547,43145,"That is the only tradition I have heard of too. We had a chocolate cake with chocolate covered strawberries for my husband's groom's cake. I have seen some pretty creative ones for football, or college. You can go any way you want with it."
4499,43145,"I think black is very eloquent for a wedding. My cousin's wedding was black with brightly colored flowers. Very beautiful! For my bridesmaids I chose the color of the dress and had them each pick out the dress they felt most comfortable in. That way they didn't feel awkward standing in front of everyone comparing who looks better in the dress. "
4497,43145,"Don't cut the guest list. My husband grew up in Pennsylvania and me in Texas, so the wedding was in Texas, and of course more people showed up that I knew. Family members sat on the ""bride"" or ""groom"" side, but then our ushers sat everyone else equally on each side. I've been to weddings where the ushers ask if we have a preference to which side, or if we minded sitting on ""the other"" side."
4451,43145,"My ceremony and reception were at the same place. In order to save people from having to wait so long between each we took all our bridal pictures before the wedding and with immediate family. (Yes I saw my groom before the ceremony.) Then after the wedding we took our large group picture with all the family members. (For those who showed up a minute before I walked down the isle.)"
4400,43145,"My mother-in-law is in Pennsylvania and the wedding was in Texas. We kept in contact through email. My husband's 2 sisters were bridesmaids so I talked to his mother a lot about that, and she also paid for the rehearsal dinner, but asked me for options of what places to use. Other than that I told her to just enjoy the wedding and enjoy being around family. "
4182,43145,"I had 3 months total to plan my wedding (I wasn't the kind to plan before the man proposed). So after setting the date and place then choosing the color for my bridesmaids they had about 2 months to find their dress. Needless to say God was great and they were all gorgeous for the wedding! I had 4 bridesmaids, and they were all able to pull it off."
4898,42791,"Karen made some good points for a formal sitting. Counting a child plate also has a lot to do with your budget. The chef may have to account for different ingredients than that of the adults, different china, etc. If you plan on having a buffet type of service, it would probably be good protocol to count the children as adults anyway. One of the worst things that can happen in a reception is running out of food. Hope this helps!"

Congratulations on your engagement!

I just wanted to let you know about a promotion we are running.

4725,19373,"I most agree with Lloyd's and Christina P., a pre-reception is a wonderful idea. I do that for my weddings. When the couple is taking pictures or whatever I have the guest go to the reception location and there is light refreshments waiting till the couple is done. In your case if the church has a dining area ask if you my use it and serve your guest light refreshments until your actual reception is ready to start. This will help your out of town guest and locals as well, so they don't have too much traveling to do. The local coffee shop idea is also a good one from Vow. Just in case the chruch is not equipped for this sort of thing.

All our guests traveled to be with us, so we had a weekend of events at various locations. The redwoods forest is just beautiful and its a quick trip to the beach.  If you are planning a big event, the Guild charges $1800 and you have all their facilities, tables, chairs (the works) for the day for the wedding of your dreams.  Too expensive?  Reserve the picnic section at Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park for $150.  It would be more rustic, but there are tables, benches, a concrete pad, bathrooms - plus, you're right on the river.  If its a much smaller affair, you could still do it at Henry Cowell and not worry about reserving the large area.

Also, if you and your fiancee have a favorite restaurant, you could always contact the restaurant and see if they have a small private room for parties of more than 10, and take your guests there. You can pre-pick the dishes you want to serve..like chicken and beef dishes, so this way your guest do have on option on the meal, but not price. Get the staff to serve a yours and his fav. cocktails (1 to each guest) and serve that with cake. :) Hope that helps!"

4895,43524,"When I got married, the first thing I did was set my budget.  Then I picked a date, and started to research venues.  Budget IMO has got to be the first thing you work on.  Without it you have no idea where to look for things!  HTH"
2154,43496,"An experienced photographer should be able to capture all of the formal/traditional poses within 30-45 minutes. That is, if you want the photos after the ceremony to be all posed.  

I also do traditional poses but then I like to mix it up and do some fun poses with the B&G and bridal party. These shots make for a great wedding album. In addition, the emotions of the ceremony also make great shots and tell the story of the day.  I have been able to capture tears rolling down the B&G's eyes as they see each other for the first time during the ceremony.  As a photographer, I can feel the love in the atmosphere when that moment of anticipation finally arrives. 

Therefore, I would suggest you take a few photos of bride and bridal party and groom and bridal party but not the B&G together.  The reason why you are hiring a photographer is to capture the emotions and celebration of your special day.  If every phase is setup and posed, you will get a canned wedding album that lacks emotions."
4266,42514,"I so agree with you. My finace name is George but his middle name is Lamont and his family and friends call him Mont. Why do people beleive that is his correct name and they tend to ask me who is George. Well it seems that everyone is big on nicknames and when I ask him for the correct names of his family memebers and friends he has no idea. How is that possible? You have known these people all your life and you don't know their first name of even how to spell it. I have spent to much time researching and following up it has been very time consuming but so important. My name is ""Stacey"" and I get annoyed when it is spelled ""Stacy"", so I totally agree with you take the time and make sure you have the correct spelling of first and last names."

5002,42869,"If I were you, I would go ahead and start shopping now.  The sooner you can decide on dresses, the better.  Go ahead and find your perfect gown, that way you can communicate with the store about how long it will take to order, have alterations made, etc.  You will find in some cases your perfect dress may take only 1 month to come in, however another dress may take up to a year.  It really will depend on the if the store already has some in stock (ie like David's Bridal), or if the dress will have to be ordered or specially made.  If you can go ahead and get all those answers figured out, then by the time your mom is ready to buy your dress, you won't have anything to stress over.  

Bridesmaids dresses usually aren't too difficult.  Go ahead and get all of your girls to give you their measurements, that way, once you are ready to order the dresses, you're not having to wait on one girl's measurements and you can order them all together.  Main thing: prevent stress on yourself!"

I have my wedding in June and just ordered mine yesterday and they told me it would be here in april I've also known people to be told they're dress won't be in for 4 months and it's shown up as early as 4 weeks.

4895,39832,"Don't Panic.  I put together a very nice affair in a Hotel wihin 6 months for our Wedding.  This is your special day as a couple, and you should discuss what the two of you want to happen that day and how you want to honor your committment.  Be careful not to fall into the trap of what everyone else's idea of that day should be...Be strong and take your time to think about what the two of you want. Once you sort that out. Ultimately the other poster is correct.  The type of event you have will vary by the budget you have. Start your research on the Internet.  Many venues, hotels and restaurants post their room layouts, menus and pricing on their websites.  Ask other brides you know what they did and did not like about their Wedding.  Do not jump the gun and ask everyone you know to be in your Wedding.  There is plenty of time for all that.  Wait until the idea is formed, the budget is set and then the deposits for the vendors are made.  Good luck, Have fun and enjoy this blissful time."
5002,42931,"I am a wedding planner here in MD and work with many Bridal Shops.  All of the shops that I work with state that it takes approximately anywhere from 12-16 weeks  once the order has been placed to have it back in the shop.  Then you have to consider the time it will take for alterations.   Bridesmaids dresses normally take about 10 - 12 weeks to return (the shops say 12 but I have always found them to come back a little quicker.  September is becoming a popular month for weddings and because of this it is wise to shop early as the more brides getting married in the same month as you, the longer it may take to have your dress back in time.  Hope that helps a bit."

5002,43421,"you'll have 5 months. thats plenty of time. gives you more time to squeeze into a better one too!"
4034,44316,"it sounds like everything turned out great for your dress and you have inspired my attitude for the beginning of my dress shopping experience.  Cherish the fact that you got to watch your mothers reaction to the dress you will wear the day you will get married.  I do not live near my mother and I am having trouble finding people who will go dress shopping with me (other than my fiance who i do not want to be the one to help me buy my dress).  So remember it is all about you your partner and those who love you and want to share the day.  The detail are just details, its about the big picture."
5053,43545,"Were having 10 people total in our wedding party, that's including us LoL. My fiance wanted a small wedding about 100, but his family is HUGE, and so is mine. Were having 200. Every person ive talked to say 200 is plenty. You also have to remember everyone you invite wont show up. So invite 400 but not all of them will show up. I personally think 400 is WAY to big. Like you said it has a price tag and if your on a tight budget that'll be a tough one."
4034,21053,"It has been a long road - almost did not like it again (LOL) but then got through that - like the 2 dress bride. All the girls who have seen the pictures say it is gorgeous. Anyway- to the last gal - what I did for all the times I went by myself ( I am on the west coast - Mama on the East) I took a camera and politely asked - sometimes begged- the sales persona to take a photo. Then I emailed it to my maid of honor and my mom. 

When I went home for a trip is when we shopped together and well you know the rest of the story. Good luck and best wishes on dress shopping!"
5052,26876,"You should call together with your fiance. This way she will see that you have his back and he has yours in this matter(wedding). I would not try to compromise your wedding for her as far as the date and having children, because that might give her room to have a say in the future in your marriage. Sometimes mothers and fathers need a reality check about their kids getting married, and sometimes its harsh, but you know what I wouldn't stress over it. If she liked you before she still likes you. She's just stressed over her youngest (baby) getting married, I don't think it has to do with you. So relax, grab your man, get on the phone, and talk it would with her. You don't have to sound mean, but sound firm, so that she knows that you both are serious about the wedding and its YOUR(fiance and you) day. You know what I told my Mother in law about not having kids at the wedding? I told her, this is a wedding not a birthday party. And she got the point. Good luck! "
5064,26876,"I used wine bottles and I got them personlized. It was sort of pricey, but the guest did appreciate it. And, at each place setting I bought mini wine glasses and I filled those up with mints. People that it was so cute and it went well with the wine bottles. There are so many things you can do. Whats your theme, what are your colors. Is there something significant about the location you are having it? "
5053,26876,"To tell you the truth, you probably wont end up inviting 400 people. You will go through you guest list so many times and each time you always get rid of some people. I orginally had over 200 people on my guest list and we ended up with about 100. And its true not everyone you invite will show up. So sit down with your fiance go over you budget do some research about cost per head. And your not being unreasonable, you are right a big wedding party is ridiculous in my opinion, and a lot of people means a lot of money, and not to mention more stress! unless he is willing to help out significantly. "
5051,24830,"I know of one outside of Lancaster, closer to Reading, in Sinking Spring, PA.  We're getting married at the Beverly Hills Tavern, which is nice and very casual.  It has a little bit of everything from a farmhouse/tavern to a beach atmosphere outside.  It also has a willow tree and a pond for pictures.  The price is VERY reasonable!  Another idea is possibly a nice winery?  I was looking at few in Lancaster, and their prices were also pretty reasonable!  Good luck!!"
5074,21205,"When I booked my cruise back in September, I just put down the minimum deposit and they told me I had until the end of July to have it paid off, but its competely up to you if you want to pay up from or just put down a deposit.  and really it depends on if youre going on a cruise or a resort or something like that.  The cruise we were booked for had the cheapest rate for that particular cruise that they had ever seen and the rate were going to go up soon so they advised putting down a deposit to lock in those rates.  But like I said its up to you."
5064,26153,"This works if u have a young crowd coming to the wedding...

I am the same way, I didnt want to do what everyone else was, but I wanted something cute and unheard but cheap also. So...what my fiance and I are going to do is go to Sam's club and buy ring pops by the bulk...(we need 300 or so) So however many guests you will have...then buy mesh bags, (little ones) you can get these offline or @ stores. We are pre-making the bags with tags tied on them that say...""He placed the ring upon her finger, a promise that will last forever."" either the day/night before my bridesmaids and I are going to unwrap all the ring pops (so they dont get ikky sitting out for days) And put them in the bags. Super easy, and can be cheap depending upon where u get your bags. Just print the tags off the computer or get a stamp made. Lots of work, but worth it!"
5032,26153,"I agree with Christina. Tea length dresses are not any less formal, and are really cute!! I personally like the strapless tea length. This also allows u to incorporate colors if you do a ribbon around the waists. Alfred angelo, (www.alfredangelo.com) has dresses all over, you'd have to locate a store, but they have some super cute tea length dresses. "
4893,26153,"Something we did @ my sisters which was fun, and I think we will end up doing it at mine is making the bride a shirt with a checklist on it. (you can also order them offline if u are not creative) If you guys like to have fun and get a little crazy, this is a lot of fun. Some things on the shirts include getting a condom from a guy, getting a guy to buy you a sex on the beach, getting someones boxers, dancing with a guy with the same name as ur finace...and so on. Lots of ideas online if u want to make your own. Also have each bridesmaid buy a tank and go to a craft store and buy rhinestones...spell out ""maid of honor"", and ""bridesmaid"" on their shirts. then it's fun for everyone!"
4760,26153,"Black eyed peas- ""let's get it started"" is a fun one for young couples....otherwise I like to kick it old school with ""pump up the jam"" we havent picked a song yet either, but my sister did ""let's get it started"" and it was a hit, and was tons of fun!"
4167,26153,"Your other option is not to have any. If it's something that you don't care about either way. I know my nieces and nephew to be will be 3, 8 and 7..So we are having the 3 year old be flower girl..and the 8 year old being a junior bridesmaid but having them walk together cuz 3 is a little young. We are not having a ring bearer, but having a ""mini usher"" who will help hand out programs and such. So that is another option. just do a mini bridesmaid and mini usher otherwise. "
3939,26153,"I agree to get it polished right before, but to keep it shining use half amonia (so?) half warm water and a scant of dishsoap. I was told to do this about 2x a month and it keeps my ring sparkling!!! Just leave it sit for about 10-15 min, then clean it with a soft toothbrush. I wear mine everyone, shower, everything. But not when im cleaning and using chemicals, i dont know what they do to it, but scratches can't be avoided. just get it buffed before hand. "
4995,44508,"Considering the time of your reception,and your budget I would recommend to you having a shrimp & Pasta dinner or Herb roasted chicken with a rice pilaf & a vegetable of your choice. Since the time of your reception is dinner time. I would also have a fruit & cheese display. For drinks maybe a sweet Ice tea & taosting champagne. 

Don't forget there is also wedding cake to enjoy! 

Good luck & best wishes!"
5055,29854,"I was the same way at the beginning.  Then I just thought about the hobbies and song that I like.  And came up with diamonds and pearls.  I am a big Prince fan.  I was going to use purple but I seen to family and friends with that color, so I went with a color we both like.  Which was orange.  Well I am going with  palm beach coral.  I is kind of hard finding things of that color but I love the color.  Black seems to be the new color for weddings lately.  It is so easy to find things that go together with it."
5031,34950,"I have a few song suggestions to share:

Recessional Songs 
(music to enjoy while waiting for the ceremony to start)

* You and I - Steve Wonder
* Ribbons in the Sky - Steve Wonder
* A whole new world - Peabo Bryson/Regina Belle

If you like Jazz:
Songbird - Kenny G.
Forever in love - Kenny G.

Suggested first dance song suggestion:
This will be - Natalie Cole

Precessional Songs

Hope you like some of these choices.  My pleasure to share.  You can pretty much use them for various choices."
4735,11925,"It depends on the vendor. Many caterers and venues include the gratutity in the final bill. As for officiants, dj's, photographer's, waiter's there are several things to take into account. For officiants, dj's, and photographer's, if they are business owner I would say no to tipping. If they are employee, then a tip would be appropriate if they did a good job. I know that hair stylist and servers usually expect a tip. As business owner I rarely get tips, but have occassionally received a gift card to a nice restaurant. The best tip you can give a vendor is referrals to friends & family getting married in the future!!"
5009,11925,"Have you considered asking if your future mother-in-law if she would cook at the rehersal dinner instead? The rehersal dinner could be held somewhere less formal than the actual wedding. I would explain to you mother-in-law (if possible) that you have been unable to find a venue that will allow her to cook, but that you would be honored if she would prepare the meal for the rehersal dinner. After all it is customary for the grooms family to host the rehersal dinner."
5088,1616,"Be very upfront and ask if there are any discounts available. Some venues offer discounted rates for booking on Friday or Sunday instead of Saturday night. Some may even offer a discount if your reception is booked early enough in the day to allow them to book another event that evening. 

If you are having your reception at a hotel, you may be able to get a discount if you book your rehearsal dinner or bridesmaids' luncheon with them."
5074,1616,"You shouldn't be required to pay the entire balance upfront unless it is very close to the date of the trip."
5064,1616,"Think of something that represents you as a couple. 
Let your favors reflect your personalities or something you are known to do together."
5093,1616,"Yes you certainly can use his title. "
5031,1616,"Just consider how long all the different songs would have to play and whether or not there is a lot of idle time becaue of it. For example, it will not tale the groom and best man a long time to come out unless they are walking down the aisle too."
4730,35704,"We do not want children coming to our wedding. Most children are great and would not cause a problem but we have several family members whose children are awful! Unless children's names are included on the invitations, parents should know that children are NOT invited. However, many people do not know that and think that they can bring their kids anywhere. Just in case, we are having babysitters at the ceremony and reception. "
5055,35704,"I like the greyish/silver look with tuxes as well. Personally, I don't think you have to do bright colors just because it will be springtime. You want the flowers you use to be seasonal, but you don't have to do something that you dont like or that is not your personality. Simple white flower to accent would be pretty."
4518,35704,"If your fiance wants you to submit to a polygraph test, it is going to be a looooong road honey. First of all, he should trust you. Second of all, consider what you did to get yourself in this situation. You should act appropriately so that he will never have a reason to question your fidelity. I doubt a polygraph will actually strengthen your relationship, if that is what it takes to make him trust you, there are more serious issues here."
5064,39503,"My wedding was outdoors so there was a chance that it could be too warm for some.  So we bought sandalwood fans (about $1) each.  I made tassels for them in my wedding colors and tied a tag on with pretty ribbon.  The tag simply said ""Thank you for sharing our special day"" with our names and the date.

And we love chocolate, so we bought a bunch of different types of Hershy Kisses.  I bought round labels the size of the bottom of the Kiss and printed them on my computer with ""Our Wedding Day"" and the date around the outside of the circle and our initials in the middle.  My flower girl took the job of putting all the labels on the bottom of the Kisses - and was very proud of her work.  It took me awhile to get the label laid out - so if you're interested I'd be happy to share it with you.  Just let me know what you'd like it to say and I can email it to you."
5001,39503,"We were in the exact same situation.  My family didn't want to hear it and just kept asking.  My aunt told me that if I didn't register I would get a lot of stuff that I didn't want and returning it would be a big chore.  She said if I registered at just one place then I'd get stuff I wanted and if I didn't, I could return everything at one time.  We did a honeymoon registry at WeddingSolutions.com and told everyone that's what we preferred.  As a backup, we did a registry at Macy's.  The Macy's registry had things we  thought we could use, but very few items - maybe 15. 

We got almost everything on the Macy's registry, our honeymoon paid for, lots of checks and gift cards, and guess what, we still got a lot of random things from stores all over the place.

So my advise, register for items you want and don't worry about how many stores you use. I think the main thing is to have items in lots of different price categories to give your guests a choice."
5008,39503,"I'd check the Farmers Almanac or maybe WeatherChannel.com to see what the averages are.  Or check with your venue, they should know.  I live in Sacramento and had my wedding in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  Very different weather conditions, so I had to do some research to figure out the right time of year.  Good luck!"
5031,39503,"Your wedding should be a reflection of you and your fiance - including the music.  We're children of the 60's and often say the Beatles wrote the soundtrack of our lives - so it was no surprise to our family and friends to hear Beatles' song throughout!  We came in to ""Something (in the way she moves)"", during the ceremony ""My Life"" and we exited to ""All you need is love"".  Have fun, this is your day and you're only going to do it once so do it the way you want!"
5052,39503,"I agree 100% with Christine.  Some other points you may make with her are that the 2 of you are making planning and making decisions based on budget, space, whatever.  And children don't fit in that mix, but of course, some people may choose to ignore your requests and you'll choose to forgive them.  Because this is YOUR special day and you refuse to give anyone the power to ruin it for you.  

My wedding mantra was that everyone was doing everything with love in their heart and the best intentions (and I didn't care if that was true or not). I said it to anyone who tried to stir anything up - and it worked!  I stayed cool and so did everyone else.  We had the best day ever."
5076,39503,"Our wedding was outdoors and lasted all day, so it easy to include children. We hit the jackpot with our caterer.  The chef came out to see if the children would like to enjoy what the adults were having or would they like to order something special.  While I had the salads served individually, the entrees were served family style.  Perfect for our Italian feast.  It was funny to see that some of the kids ate (and enjoyed) the adult dishes and the others spoke up and ordered pasta with butter. The kids all stuck together, ate, played, danced - when the wedding dvd came, it was great to see some of the things they were up to while we were all enjoy the adult wedding scene.  My dog was also a guest and he stuck with the kids, enjoying every minute."
5055,39503,"I think that is perfect.  If everything is bright, it just seems like a circus.  Ask your florist or floral warehouse what local flowers are in season for April. That will help with keeping it cost effective, if there is something that you like in season locally grown.  Another way to keep it cost effective is to find a large flower in a color you like, then just tie a large ribbon around 1 to 3 of them for your bouquets.  

At my wedding the bridesmaids wore navy, the flowergirl and I wore white. The groom wore midnight tux with white shirt, tie and vest.  The best man wore a midnight tux with white shirt and pale blue vest and tie.  For the girls, we all carried blue hydrangeas with white roses - mine was bigger, of course.  For the guys, we did boutineeres with a peacock feather, delphinum and a green thing (the name escapes me).  All the flowers were in season, locally grown and cost effective.  For the wedding and reception, less than $200. See my photos."
5053,39503,"Don't argue about the number of guests.  Set your budget and stick to it.  That will dictate a lot of things, starting with the number of guests.  The cost per guest begins with the print cost of the ""save the date"" cards and invitations, then the postage.  And it keeps adding up.  There's seating space at the wedding ceremony, then there's the reception food, drinks, cake, and it just keeps adding up. It will surprise you how fast it can sneak up on you. It did us."
4995,39503,"I can tell you what we did. It was cost effective and everyone is still raving about the food. Of course, the chef deserves all credit for the delicious food.

While we did posed photos, our guests were treated to a buffet of various bruschettas and antipasta trays. The colors were gorgeous. Then we had a sit down dinner, with individually served salad, then family style pastas (one vegetarian and one with a mixture of meats).  Followed by wedding cake for dessert.  All organic, locally grown Italian food - can't beat it!  "
5009,39503,"IF you want to grant your mother-in-law's wish, it is possible.  If you don't, then this is a perfect way to get around that - and use the other's suggestions for still allowing her to cook and have your dream wedding/reception too.

I can't help you with specific locations as I'm in Northern California and got married in the Santa Cruz Mountains. But I found a place for my wedding that rented us the space and let us do what we wanted. It was all outdoors and glorious.  Those places do exist! Also, we rented the picnic area of the state park there and it would have been a great spot for wedding and reception.  So check out the facilities at the parks in your area. 

Keep looking to find what is perfect for you - it took me 2 years! But if you want to keep your July date, you better get busy girl."
968,39503,"My wedding photographer requested that I do a Trash the Dress shoot with her for her portfolio. Couldn't do it with MY dress, so I went back to eBay to buy a 2nd beautiful dress and went for it.  We went out on 2 separate days to an area that is special - with lots of different scenery. We shot in an alfalfa field, in a recently plowed field, on farm equipment, in a walnut grove, and IN the American River.  You can see a sample of the photos on steveandkaren/shutterfly.com or on the photographer's website eheizerphotography.com

Here's the amazing thing I learned, those dresses are bullet proof.  I have to admit I had no emotional bond with this dress, so it was easy after the first day of shooting to spray the grass, grease, and dirt stains with Spray N Wash, wash it in the machine and hang it on the line to dry.  Looked like new. Did the same after the 2nd day and i'd challenge you to know I'd done it.  It may turn yellow someday, but its just a dress not my marriage."

3518,39503,"I'm still trying to figure out how to see the slideshows, but the photos i saw are beautiful.  Display your photo in the space where it will make you happy to see it.  I love to see wedding photos on display, especially years later! So put it out there and share it with all those who visit you."
4744,39503,"Its been 3 months since my wedding and we're still reeling from the euphoria from it all.  So I can't imagine having the energy to celebrate a 6 month anniversary, especially with a big 1 year celebration planned. At the same time, you should celebrate in some way every day you are together. Congratulations! Best wishes for a long and happy life together!  I've enjoyed your photos and your thoughtful comments on the pages."
5030,10000,"With lime green and a bright clean yellow, pink will fall into place perfectly. 

Do not doubt your sense of aesthetics. It is fabulous and fresh!"
4995,43545,"We are doing our own food. Were having our favorite meat, our favorite potatoe, favorite vegtable, and then while the guest are waitting for us were having like an appetizer set up. It'll have shrimp cocktail, veggie tray, cheese tray. Were also having punch, and an open bar with pop. Very simple and it's not that expensive, just try and get most everything on sale and you'll be set :-) Every caterer we looked at wanted $15-$30 a PERSON for food. So were buying our own and we'll have one or two people in charge of it."
5074,30237,"Hello.

If you are booking on the internet, they generally require you to pay in full.  If however, you are booking through a travel agent, they usually have relationships with their supplies who will allow you to make a deposit.

Do you have a honeymoon registry?  This is a great way to help off-set the cost of your honeymoon.

You can enroll for free on my website at http://naomi.allabouthoneymoons.com.  The average amount one of my brides earns is around $2,500.

To find a good travel agent in your area who can provide you with a unique honeymoon experience, you can go to http://www.myweddinagent.com or http://www.allabouthoneymoons.com

5051,43873,"I did my nephew's wedding in Lancaster. The ceremony and reception were held at the Mulberry Art Studio http://www.mulberryartstudios.com/ and it was a pretty nice place. I wouldn't call it the most elegant, but it had a nice feel to it. I'm sure there are other art galleries who do weddings. 

Keep me in mind when you're looking for a photographer.

Sam"
4723,43873,"I live near the beach, but am willing to travel for weddings. There are two of us who photograph every wedding and we will stay as long as you want us to.
Please check out my website to see if our style suits you. www.samellis.com.

As for the comment about two photographers getting in the way, we are very discreet and are always aware of where we are and try to stay out of the way. 

I do have September 29th available, if you would like to discuss your wedding plans, please email me at sam@samellis.com.

Thank you,
Sam"
5051,44910,"I would have to agree with the post about the Mulberry arts studio. I DJ'd a Bat Mitzvah there and it was very nice. I can certainly picture a nice classy yet relaxed and casual atmospher for a wedding. They were very creative with the decor there of course being an art studio. Another place in Lancaster I have DJ'd at several times has been the Eden Resort and Lancaster Host resort, both are very nice, with several different rooms to choose from.
Best of Luck

4452,43675,"I have not heard of it. I did log onto it, and it is out of Canada...so I am not sure if that is why you have not received any responses (assuming you are in the US)

If you research, you will find vendors that are resonable and will work with you. I work with all my client and offer a monthly payment plan (much easier to break down a $1500 payment into 12 monthly payment then to pay a lump sum at once!) It never hurts to ask when you are talking to vendors...some will work with you...

I & my other half had to pay for our ceremony with no help from either side...it is hard to do, and I think that is why - 1 I price my photography moderately and 2 I work with every client if they need me to! Not everyone has parents that are willing to fork out $40000 for a wedding!

Good luck. "
5110,34950,"I would suggest 2 weeks before your wedding date.  This would allow time to contact the caters (if you have them) with an updated count for food servings."
4723,43675,"I live about 45mins from Bmore. Feel free to check out my site. Have done weddings from Philly to Va Beach and every where in between. All of our packages come standard with two photographers...I do not charge extra for that.Plus no travel fees and depending on the package, we are there from the minute you step foot in the salon (or wherever you are getting your hair done) to the minute you and your new hubby get in the limo to leave!"
5110,4007,"I would suggest taking your caterer's deadline for a final count + 1 week - usually that is 2 -3 wks before the wedding, which will allow you more time to create your seating plan."
5030,31124,"  Thanks!"
4734,44489,"Increasingly popular (at least at weddings I've attended recently) is no garter toss AT ALL. No explanation needed. There's no reason for you to be embarassed on your day. Also consider this for the bridal bouquet: Instead of tossing, present it to the couple in attendance who've been married the longest. It's a sweet sentiment, and definitely something guests remember because it's different than the norm."
4178,44489,"I'm having a cake reception and including fruit and vege trays for munching. My wedding is at 2 pm, with the reception immediately following at the same venue (my parent's backyard). But, I agree that you should state that on the invitation. It really is too much to assume that people will eat lunch before the wedding, and instead bring their appetites to the reception!"
5110,26876,"I would suggest no less than 3 weeks prior to your wedding. Even if you give a date to respond by, you know not all guests will reply by then, you will have some coming in a few days late maybe even more than that. So take that into consideration and give yourself plenty of time to plan last minute things."
5133,26876,"Plan as you would a regular wedding, the only difference being your parents are not in the wedding planning or party. I would still invite them even if they don't show up. Atleast they can't say that you didn't. And, really you don't have to explain yourself, you know the reasons why you are doing it this way and your guests should not have to ask as to why, the point is that its your day and what ever you and your fiance decide should be respected. "
5127,26876,"I think instead of a wedding shower you should plan for their 6mo. anniversary, or 1 yr. I think people would see a shower as an excuse for gifts and not so much as a celebration. Whereas an anniversary is a celebration, and people often times bring gifts. It just seems awkward having a shower after the fact...you know? If you do go with an anniversary celebration, on the invite I would put something like gift cards welcomed, so that atleast guests don't see it as an obligation to bring a gift, but will consider it. I guess what I am really trying to say is if you are trying to do something for the sake of gifts, then that seems kinda wrong, guests should never really be expected to bring gifts afterall no matter what the event is. Good luck!"
5133,43519,"You don't have to explain anything to anyone. Your wedding is a day of celebration so surround yourself with close friends and family who you love and who love you too. I've attended a wedding where the brides parents weren't involved and it was just as beautiful as any ceremony I've seen."
4936,43519,"I've done several small weddings in downtown San Antonio. Marriage Island is a popular place and would be wonderful for an intimate ceremony. You'd have to contact the City of San Antonio Parks and Recreation Department at 210-207-7275 for information on reservation and fees.

You might also consider marrying elsewhere in the city and having the reception on the Riverwalk."
5142,34265,"I really wouldn't sweat it. You can definately walk down the isle by yourself, that is seen everywhere. The father-daughter dance, you should just dance with whom ever you feel took your fathers place. Whether it be an uncle, grandfather, even your fiance's father. Remeber this day is all about you. and since you haven't really kept touch with your family, you shouldn't let what they say bother you. I've even seen a bride dance with her mother!"
4940,34265,"I've been working wedding for 6 yrs now and Obviously at the end would be a good idea. This is really something that you don't need to plan for, as the last 1/2 hr rolls by people will start pulling you guys aside and giving you cards, and then a line will form on its own. "
5142,39503,"I agree 100% with Marta.  This is your wedding, your day - the only person I would worry about is YOU and your fiance.  Both of my parents are deceased and the one uncle I would have considered is quite ill, so I did it on my own. At the rehearsal my groom suggested that I walk down the aisle with someone even with him. But I told him this was symbolic of me, how I've lead my life, and how I'm entering this marriage - of my own accord and volition.  I won't tell you what to do, just do what makes YOU happy.

5133,45310,"I agree with the other responses.  In case you have some questions about the processional and other places where parents are traditionally involved...  I was recently at wedding in which the bride had lost both her parents.  She was escorted down the aisle by a long-time, parent-aged friend and a close uncle.  It was really just very lovely-- it didn't seem to highlight the absence of her parents; instead, it just honored the friend and uncle and gave them a chance to show their support too.  Other people I know have asked dear friends (especially older friends/aunts/etc) to fill in when their parents were not there.   I would expect an officiant to have ideas as well if these are concerns you have. "

5160,26876,"I kinda had a similar problem in my wedding. My husband's dad and mother are divorced and he has completely stepped out of the picture and has had nothing to do with them. Everyone thought that it was so wrong that he was not even invited to the wedding let alone even know that we were getting married. My mother in law wants nothing to do with him, and she even threatened me with ""...if he comes, Im not coming."" Fortunately, my fiance really didn't want his father there anyway so it wasn't a big deal. B, if you want your father there tell your mother that he will be there for YOU and not for her. She may threaten you with the same thing, but I would tell her that she is being selfish. Talk to your dad tell him that you want him there but you don't want to have any problems. Ask him if he thinks he can come without starting anything, and ask your mom as well. You have to emphasize that this is your day and they need to respect your wishes."
4897,26336,"Everyone has given you some great advice and almost everyone has agreed that you must choose your date, than begin to contact locations for your ceremony and reception. Based on availability you may need to adjust your wedding date. 
Once you have booked your ceremony and reception location, you are half way there. As a partner of ABACUS WEDDING STUDIOS, I am partial to booking photography and videography for a wedding, since I truly believe that these two items are important to preserve the memories you and your friends and family work so hard to plan. 
A DJ or Band is also at the top of the list, as well as flowers and the décor you want.  
No matter what please remember, that stressing over your big day will not help it make it go smooth, so make you plans, choose your vendors and let them worry about making your wedding day perfect. After years of putting weddings together, I am always amazed at how things come together on a wedding day.

I also went to L&H Bridal right next to Gearo's and across from where the Matress Giant used to be in NE Philly and I was not pleased with the service. The woman was nice BUT they wouldn't let me take pictures, refused to tell me the styles/names of the dresses I was trying on and said it would ""take too long"" to look up the names of the dresses I wanted to try on so she didn't."
5160,26658,"As an event coordinator, I have dealt with situations like this many times.  I would encourage you to talk with your mom and get her feelings on the situation.  If he has been a good father (and she can recognize this) you may find that she expects that he will be there already and you are worrying unnecessarily.  

If she is opposed to him being in attendance, and you want him there, be honest with her and explain your feelings.  Let her know that you understand how she feels about him but that you need her to understand how you feel.  This is your wedding day and he is your father.

I would recommend a few logistical solutions to limiting any interaction they may have.  (A day of coordinator can help greatly with this by difussing situations as an outside, impartial source)  At the ceremony have prearranged seating for your parents where they are in different rows, or opposite sides of the aisle if necessary.  Also, let them each have their own table at the recepetion.  "
5101,26658,"The first thing I would try is to call the company you ordered the invitations through and ask what their policy is for reprints.  Did you sign off on all of the information being correct?  Did you receive a proof?  They may be willing to work with you on a discounted reprint."
4844,26658,"How does your fiance feel about this?  If it is extremely important to him, consider his feelings before making any decisions.

There are many roles his sisters could play other than bridesmaids.  First off, you can give them a special honor by distinguishing them with corsages.  You could have them seated up the center aisle prior to the ceremony (as his parents would have been).  You may want them at the ceremony location to act as greeters for your guests.  Female ushers are not out of the question either.  You will likely need readers for the ceremony.  If any of them are musically inclined they could sing or play an instrument during the ceremony.  You could also ask them to do a joint toast at the reception.  There are many options, asking them what they prefer to do may make them feel more involved as well!"

5127,33103,"I don't see anything wrong with it, so long as it's not called a shower; that would seem awkward considering that the couple being showered is already married.  Instead, just call it a luncheon, host it at your home or a local function hall (depending on the number of attendees), and invite those that you feel would have been on the guest list had there been more time to plan a proper reception.  

Most if not all attendees (if they've got even a hint of class) are likely to bring a gift without being asked to do so.  So, I'd refrain from the previous respondent's suggestion of saying that gift cards are welcomed.  That's a blatant solicitation for gifts and is not appropriate.  "

I'd say you can wait to tell the sister she's in line as #2 until the rehearsal stating with two Maid of Honors, you had to pick one or another.

Either way there likely will be drama, but maybe this will at least spare the rest of the family from thinking incorrectly about you if you actually demote the sister after having already said she was your Maid of Honor. "

5052,42869,"I agree with what the others have said, but I just wanted to emphasize to you that her hatefulness towards you really has nothing to do with you.  This is something that your fiance needs to clear up with his mother, and it would be better if he is the one that initiates any kind of conversation. I think if he were to sit his mother down and talk with her calmly about how her behavior has been affecting u and him and also her relationship with you, she would be much more open to listening and understanding than if yelling and such is done in the heat of the moment.  I know this is hard on u, but try your hardest to be a supportive fiance (u dont want to burn any bridges with the words u say against her) and give his mother some time.  She is adjusting and that can sometimes take a while. Also, remember that this is YOUR wedding, so don't let ANYONE dictate what you want.

Even though I didn't used the same bridalonline store, I did bought my wedding dress at a online store. I actually tried the same dress at a chain store here in USA and then I found the same dress at this onlinestore kaersen.com. I was very skeptic to buy it online, from a manufacturer in China and afraid that I will loose my money. However, the website it is very reliable. I send my measurements, choose color, etc I just received my dress yesterday. I'm so excited and happy and the best part is that I would off paid at the chain store here in US 4 times what I paid for my dress. Good luck!"

I messed up and wanted a particuluar Turquoise color and didn't do my research that the bridemaid dresses couldn't be easily bought with the dark turquoise that I wanted (Unless I got a seamstress to make them). Now their dresses are going to be a different color than my dress gown sash. And the sash isn't the color I wanted either. Though the chair cover ties/bows and the boutonniere will all be the color I wanted. Oh well.  So, go look at the dresses for bridesmaids and sashes (if you want sashes) and go from there to coordinate. As for theme, just find out something you both like. We're both into Science Fiction and so at the Reception, we'll have a lot of Sci Fi stuff....including a glass dragon heart for the wedding topper."

"
5052,29636,"I can totally relate to your difficulties.  My fiance and I were dating for about two years before we got engaged, so I had some experience with his family beforehand.  I do feel that their attitudes changed when all this wedding stuff started.  She first complained that I was not going to include her daughter in my wedding party; I tried explaining to her that I wanted to include her in a different capacity; then she complained that our wedding will be on a Sunday; I said it's much cheaper; then she complained about the dishes we picked out on our registry; then she said we weren't taking the right trip on our honeymoon, you get the idea!  No matter what, we are not going to please her.  My family has bent over backwards for his family and they are barely hosting the rehearsal dinner.  They are making no contributions to the acutal wedding.  I think the bottom line is she'd find something to complain about no matter what, so you just have to do what makes you happy."
5053,41069,"We have an agreement.  If we haven't spoken to or heard from someone in 365 days, they are not invited.   If they did not acknowledge our engagement party, they are not invited.  That trimmed the list tremendously!  "

5161,35271,"This is actually a new trend in weddings. More couples are choosing to have a fun, relaxed cocktail reception as opposed to a formal seated dinner. One of my favorite choices is to serve your favorite foods but in a mini size! For example, mini burgers and fries or mac and cheese in small cups! Another favorite is a twist on shrimp cocktail. Place one or two shrimp in a shot glass with the cocktail sauce at the bottom. 

Typically your ceremony only last about 30 minutes. A reception outline could be organized something like this:

Cocktail Hour
Introduction of Bride and Groom
First Dance
Father Daughter Dance
Prayer or Welcome
Dinner
Toast
Cake Cutting
General Dancing
Bouqet / Garter Toss
Grand Exit

Goodluck with Planning!!"
5110,35271,"I would speak with your cater or reception facility to determine when they need your final head count. I would then give yourself a week or two in addition to that. This gives you plenty of time to put together your seating arrangements and finalize any other details."

Considering that you haven't really booked anything, I would consider the fact that a lot of people travel that weekend so you would really need to make up your mind fast and get those out ASAP! "

For his son, I am going to get him a little football with his name on it and the position he held in the wedding. I am going to give this to them at the rehersal dinner with close family and friends. 
I thought about writing/ saying something during the ceremony with them, but at their age, I don't think they'll fully understand/ listen well enough to do that. I even thought of a locket for the girls, but they don't wear real jewlery yet.... I think it depends on their age. If his kids are older, I say go for it with the vows. You could even include them in the vows you say to him- Somthing else I have thought about doing too... Good luck!"
5248,18635,"I agree with the previous post.  If you love this guy, do what your heart tells you BUT...make sure you guys talk about some of the important things...children(he's older, does he have any? does he want any? how soon will you have children?)  That kind of stuff.  Consider also the older person/control factor.  Communicate and you will be fine.  It's the key.
Hope it helps"
5227,18635,"Well I am in a similar situation.  My Future Husband has a 14 year old daughter.  SHe lives with us.  He has raised her since 11 months old.  I initially palnned to say special vows to her.  That has changed due to the way she treats me and the fact that she told her mother that she hates me.  She says this but comes to me for everything she needs.  As a teen she goes through the mood swings of course, so day to day I don't know if she loves or hates me.  SHe is a Jr Bridesmaid in the wedding but I am NOT saying vows to her.  As it gets closer this may change but they key is the relationship.  The age is only a factor when it comes to how long the vows your saying are and what is said.  
Just my thoughts

So all was well and it was my fault that I didn't double check the address. However, 3 days later I get an email saying that my dress has shipped. To the wrong address which is the other side of the state! At this point my money still hadn't posted to my account so I didn't know what was going on. So I called them again and the girl told me that it apparently accidently shipped out so it was a mistake on their part. I got my money credited back to my account the next day and they got the dress routed back to them. They DID fix the problem but they seemed very disorganized!"
5064,45819,"my daughter got married in June. For her favors she used wine toppers which she ordered on e-bay then she wrapped them her self with their names on it(did it on computer) and she also made up labels for full size wine bottles.  It went over real big and every one loved the wine(yellow tail shiraz)"
5088,23126,"We are getting married on a Tuesday. I just came out and asked since it was in the middle on the week. We got a discount on the reception site as well as hours for free from the photographer. So don't hesitate to ask, but also consider a date that is not on the weekend. You will be more likely to get a discount."
2123,23126,"It's not rude at all. We are getting married on April 1st that is a Tuesday. If your guest really want to be there they will make arrangments."
5053,40386,"Hello Marie, 

I  think just like you because a wedding should be something small & memorable for your guests. However, I was also having the same problem since my fiance also wanted something big. I was able to make him change his mind by telling him that if we do something small we will be able to save money either to purchase our house or to go on a honeymoon. Maybe you should use this technique to make him realize that you should be prepared for the future rather than spending it all now. I really think that 100 to 200 people are more than enough to have a wonderful time. Good Luck!"
5009,40386,"Hello,

Have you thought about having your wedding out-doors? Or what about if your soon to be mother-in-law cooks & you just have servers come over to the reception place to serve the food?  "
4813,40386,"Hello,

You need to do what's right because it's not you starting with the wrong foot it's your future sister & mother-in-law who are making it difficult for you so, why should you feel bad? Just fire her & continue with your plans because I don't even think that she will want to be your bridesmaid after you fire her so might as well do it now & not wait until the last moment!"
4714,40386,"Hello,

That's great that you think like that & you should have both ceremonies because it's only a double blessing for your marriage! However, I am having trouble myself since I am Catholic & want to get married by church but eventhough he was brought up as a Catholic he doesn't want to get married by church & now I'm having second thoughts do you think it's right? Sorry to give you an answer & ask you a question but I trust your judgement for some reason.  "

5256,21407,"Sure she can- I have a wedding I posted on Facebook, and not only are the dress styles different, they are all different colours. It is becoming more popular to have your girls in different designs, and not the exact same look anymore. It gives the guests a bit of a show as well when they walk up the aisle.  "
5267,21407,"Would it be worth your while to ask your mother why she isn't showing much interest in the wedding?  Have you asked her for any help? She may feel that she isn't entitled to give any input, as you are paying for the wedding. As far as your Dad goes, he may feel also that if your mother is involved, he may not want to be or, feels that he shouldn't intrude.  It's difficult to give you an proper answer without knowing more history. Good luck though. "
5267,43519,"I agree with the previous poster.  I recommend inviting your mom along anytime you go out to do wedding stuff. Some people don't want to interfere and just wait to be asked (or told) to do something.

If your mom still won't get involved, just have fun planning with your fiancee and your close friends.

(When if comes time to find a photographer, I'm available for travel to St. Louis!)

Good Luck and congratulations on the engagement!"
5143,35247,"I am also looking for an affordable DJ in the Baltimore area. Here are a couple people to look into. 

Tom Gavin's DJ Delights - They have a reasonable price, but I have had trouble getting in contact with them. They are also a large company, which scares me, with over 30 DJs. Also, I have only talked to Tom Gavin and his wife but the fact that he might not be my DJ makes me uneasy because how do I know that my wishes are going to be relayed to the DJ that I am asigned. (my estimate $809)

MusicMasters - They are another large Company with over 30 DJs. I have been talking to Dan Hawkins. He has been very nice and has been very easy to talk to and get a hold of. One thing nice about them is that you can do most of the planning online, which is easy for them to turn over to your appointed DJ. (my estimate $900)

DJ Frank Young - You deal with Frank himself. He is very good with getting back to people. I believe he is the only DJ. He willingly gave me 3 testimonies. (estimate $1000)"

5230,3645,"what timing! I just attended an intimate beach wedding at the Grand Plaza Hotel on St Pete Beach (Gulf blvd) this past weekend. It was a Friday sunset wedding with ~40 guests. The hotel setup an aisle outlined by two rows of palm trees on the beach leading up to the alter. At 5:30pm, the sunset was an magnificent backdrop. The reception was hosted at the penthouse level of hotel, amazing views and the food/service was excellent. 

"
5053,30909,"I've been to weddings before where they have a huge bridal party, and it makes it gaudy. I have never met anyone who thought it was 'nice'. and the last wedding I went to, I could not see the bride(i was sitting closer to the far end of the pew)because they had to wrap the girls in a half-moon shape to get them to all fit. and think of your pictures...getting all those people to look at the photographer with a pretty smile all at once...


We are NOT inviting ANYONE who has not personally me both of us(excluding out of state family). just something to concider. 

And if your getting help from family to pay..ask him to concider paying for the wedding himself...once he sees the price tag, haha. 
or what I had to do was ask myself ""would I take these people out to dinner for a non-special-occasion $50 per person meal?"" Thats what helped me pick my caterer and to not go overboard. "
5276,26876,"Favors are like a way of saying Thank You for coming. Its a nice gesture and momento for them to keep. You really don't have to get every single person one, maybe one per family.You can even condsider making them yourself, that saves money. Do some research online to get some ideas. So 300 people on a $5,000 budget, good luck with that. "
4560,30909,"all of this because of a picky eater? that sucks. would she expect you to have the same outrageous treatment if the roles were reversed? hmm. Tell her to brown bag it. I know how importaint it is to take your significant others side...but come on. (if hes in the wedding party)For him to not go, thats just crazy. At least you found out ahead of time. but if they are just guests, you just saved howmuch per person?? thats right! now you can buy some new shoes!haha."

I would highly recommend checking out their website and weddig packages I think you will like what you find. The website is www.palaceresorts.com. Good Luck!"
5110,14939,"the best course of action is to speak to your caterer to find out how much time they require. Please note that many times the recipient of your invitation and the various inserts will set them aside,thinking to reply immediately. Often that doesn't become reality and the senders are left wondering what on earth is going on and should they give the recipients a call. It's best to combine the time frame from the caterer with what you believe is an appropriate time for your guests. For example,if the bulk of your guests are older,more formal,you may not have a problem,but if they are very young,not well versed in general etiquette,it might be the opposite. Perhaps three weeks before the return of your information. When I do invitations and rsvp's I always make a suggestion to this effect. Incidently,years ago it was acceptable to send out invitations two to three weeks in advance,and as you know,that is increased,with the exception of very small weddings. S.Seitz invitationimaginati"
5101,14939,"there may be several ways to do this. Have you already sent out the invitations? If not,add a small insert with an image of the actual boat-with the name prominently displayed-you might find the actual image of the specific boat online. Add a small explanation on the insert. If you've not sent the invitation out,there may be a chance to have to printer rerun the order-which you would have to pay for of course. There can be a 24 hour turn around. It's been my experience,as a wedding invitation vendor,that this can be done. DO NOT speak to customer service,get to the pressman if you can and explain your problem. Again,unfortunately,you would have to pay for his or her time. sally seitz invitation imagination"
5241,46355,"I think Labor Day Weekend is a great idea, especially if you're planning on inviting families with children!"
4730,46355,"It all comes down to your own comfort level.  I've been to and photographed weddings with kids and I think they actually add something to the atmosphere.  I've never been to a wedding that was ""spoiled"" by a crying child.  Most parents are great about calming their children down or just taking them outside if they need to.  If you're planning to have any flower girls or ring bearers, there will be kids there anyway.  What really matters is what you and your fiance would like to do."
5256,31831,"Your maid of honor can definitely wear a different style and color of dress and your wedding will still come off looking beautiful. In a wedding we photographed recently, the maid of honor was not the same type of body build as the rest of the bridesmaids and she felt uncomfortable wearing the style the others were going to wear. The bride picked out a different style dress and made it white to match her wedding dress. She then had a ribbon sewn on under the bust line in the color of the bridesmaids dresses. It looked amazing and everyone was happy.

(We are available to photograph on location in Cleveland!)

Best of luck to you both and congrats on the engagement!"

5276,18608,"Congatulations on your upcoming nuptuals.  I too am having a larger wedding on a very small budget, actually 2,000$ budget.  So I have many ways to save money!  We are giving as favors, hot chocolate in which I found a website for the cone shaped bags 100 for 10$ and i am putting a scoop of mix in with a few mini marshmallows tied with a navy ribbon and a little note attached saying thanx.  As another favor we are giving a ""spoonfull of kisses"" just a plastic navy spoon with silver hershey kisses on it combined in tool tied again with a ribbon and note.  All in all these items enough for 120 people is costing no more than 56$.  

Also to save more money we are serving a variation of desserts instead of food!  And having some family members make some of their specialties.  This is making money matters really easier now!  

I hope all of this helps you good luck."
5293,18608,"Also....
We are having a snowflake theme and instead of having a traditional runner that costs about 30$ I am putting batting down to symulate the look of walking on snow, which is costing about 10$. And with saving money there, we decided to use those flat snow cloths used with Christmas scenes as tablecloths.  And instead of eating any glitter that they would give off I am using a nice sheer silver fabric I found 50% off at the fabric store as an overlay.  

I hope this helps everyone with thier wedding planning.  And as I have found you can have a beautiful wedding on a tiny budget!!!"

We had 168 people on our original guest list after our $15k budget jumped to $19k my better half saw red and decided to blame me for the budget getting out of hand. Mind you it based on his 91 guest that he feels should attend (whatever). Needless to say I told him in order for us to get back o track we need to make som major cuts so he was able to get his list down to 68 people and I was able to scale back on a few things because we now have less guest. So we are now looking at about 127 and I estimate that 5% to 10% of those will not even show. I couldn't see myself hosting wedding with over 400 guest, you wouldn't be able to enjoy yourself that would be to overwhelming."

one of my friends actually used MAC in MACYS to do her makeup... a lil over the top, and you have to spend at least 50$ to get a free ""makeup session"" but its kinda worth it they know what looks good.

I agree that a MOH should try to atleast make an effort to come out for atleast the fittings, which is a key role for her.

What looks great on a bride in reality (in the mirror, to her guests, etc.), doesn't always appear the same in a photograph.

I know it's easy to think, ""Why pay all that money for some eye shadow and lipstick, that I can apply myself?"" 

Here's my .02: pay it because, if they're professional (especially if they work in fashion or the wedding industry), they'll know how to apply makeup that will look great on you and in your photos - which you'll be looking at for years to come. :)"

But on the other hand a live band would be more elegant and classy.  We personally had a DJ for the reception but had our wedding song performed live!  There is thought for you also.  That was good because it made our song just that much more special!!"

Anyway, when we booked our (totally non-churchy) ceremony venue, they gave us a list to help us get going.  I was really nervous about the whole process - it seems like such an important thing!

It turned out to be really easy.  I spent 5 - 10 minutes on the phone with each person talking about what they do and getting a feel for their personality.  After the calls, there were 4 we couldn't stand and 1 we loved so the choice was obvious.  

If you don't have a list or any recommendations, I don't think that the phone book or internet listings are too crazy of a place to start.  Talk to a bunch and meet with your favorites if you can.  You'll know. =)"

1319,5592,"Trashing your dress can be as little or as much as you like.  Some girls truly choose to ruin it beyond repair and others just aren't afraid to get a bit of dirt on it.

The truth is that after the wedding most women do not use their dress again.    You probably slaved over picking just the right one so why not have fun with it and be a model for a day.  Ask your hubby to go along in black slacks a nice shirt and tie and you can get some romantic images to die for.

If you still want to keep the dress after the session talk with your photographer about locations where it may get wet or dirty but most likely nothing a good cleaning won't take out.  Have fun and Trash it if you Dare!

Definitely my favorite way to end a wedding."

As for your question, my husband and I never really worked out together but we would take long walks every night with our dogs.    If you are looking to work out to tone or lose weight, I would say try kickboxing together, it is really fun, and you work up a good sweat, it gets your heart really going!  Otherwise I would say long walks, it is exercise and you have the time to communicate and share your day with each other!"

It is important to stay organized and remember the big picture as you work through the months leading up to the event.  Weddingwire has a great to-do list that you should really utilize because they have all the due dates, timelines, etc.  

Also to make things easier, there are a lot of companies out there that will offer the services of a wedding coordinator, such as your caterer, decorator, ceremony and/or reception planner.  By minimizing the number of people you need to coordinate with, it will lessen your stress.  For example, our company offers floral design, decorating, custom bridesmaids dresses, main points of contact for our referrals for bands, media, photographers, etc. so you have one main point of contact for all these services.  

Hope this helps!

My name is Parris Whittingham. I am a Wedding Photographer based in New York. Consider my words. Makeup for film and real life are completely different.  I learned this the hard way when I had a stage makeup class back in college. You should expect to pay any professional for their time , however, you are also paying for their expertise. Would you trust an amateur to shoot your wedding...maybe, however, in doing this you accept the inherent risks. 

PROFESSIONALS DELIVER PROFESSIONAL RESULTS. Ask around for referrals, meet with your makeup artist, ask to see samples, but try to limit your risks and make the job of your photographer easier....hehehhehe. He/she will thank you with amazing photos and you wont have to worry about the dreaded ""shiny nose"". I hope this was helpful :) All the best

I printed round labels with our wedding date, initials and a little message ""Our Wedding Day"".  The flower girl was thrilled to have a project all her own.  She spent a couple of hours putting the labels on the bottom of each kiss.  She was quite proud.  It took me a while to figure out the printing layout on the labels, so if anyone is interested in cutting a time corner - I'd be happy to email you the template.  Just send me an email."

Good luck!"
5372,39503,"One of the very first tasks of planning your wedding is setting your budget.  That includes $ amounts for each line item.  Then it is your job to stay within budget as much as possible.  If you can't do that you are risking starting your married life off on the wrong foot.  What one person may consider too much may be pocket change for the next - so it is all about your personal budget for your wedding.  

That said, if she's is set on that dress and it is out of line for your budget.  Then I suggest she look for the dress at sample sales, online sales, etc.  I bought my dress on eBay for less than $50.  It is beautiful, from the Demetrios Ilyssa collection and originally retailed for much more.  So it is possible to have your cake and eat it too.  Just takes a little more work.  If you're thinking I'm crazy, just take a look at my photos - the dress was beautiful and exactly what I wanted."
5372,26876,"If your paying for the whole thing even the wedding dress than you need to explain to her your budget, and that she needs to stay within those boundries. $1100 is pretty expensive for a dress you will only wear for a few hours and once. If she is not willing to budge then try to see if she is willing to compromise something else in order for her to have her ""dream"" dress. Like if she really wants to have tall centrepieces, which by the way are expensive, is she willing to give those up for the dress or vice versa. I mean there are ways around it, but you got to be smart about it to. In my opinion $1100 for a dress is a waste of money, no matter how pretty it is, especially if its going to compromise my budget. My dress was $750, and even that is too much, but my parents bought it as a tradition. Good Luck and remember you shouldn't have to compromise your wallet to make her happy, she should be happy anyway."

5014,43496,"I understand the need to find a photographer that is within your budget and a true professional.  This is my suggestion.  First off, define what products you want your photographer to produce.  Do you want any album with high quality photographs?  Do you want them edited?  Are you looking for a Photojournalist to capture the day in a story book style way with many candid shots?  Do you want formal poses of the bridal party and family?  Do you want the rights to your digital negatives?  There are many questions that you must ask yourself before seeking a Pro Photographer.  I suggest you arm yourself with questions and just head out the door to three really good photographers.  They will educate you and you may find that what you are looking for is within your budget.  Don't be afraid, photographers don't bite and they will not pressure you.  They may guide you and become the most valuable vendor you hire for your special day.  Oh by the way, their product will be around for a life time."
5383,26876,"Im sorry to hear that, but you really can't make someone like you. They must have their reasons for not liking you, whatever those may be. What would suggest is that, you seriously sit down with your fiance and see how he feels about his parents not liking you. To be honest with you, I would even post pone the wedding because you really do not want to have this sort of tension in your marriage. As much as people say that you shouldn't let the in laws get involved with you marriage, the fact of the matter is that they will, especially if they don't like you. I think you should try to resolve this before you get married, because it may only get worse later on, and you can't say that you will cut them off, because those are your fiance's parents and will always be  no matter how much the hate you. Try to have a family meeting with his parents and him involved and express your feelings and let them know you have a right to know why they don't like you. "
5357,46359,"I think that would def. be enough for a favor. If your budet does allow a picture frame at each seat with your weding date engraved would be a fabulous idea but the photo booth alone is a perfect idea- I love it1"
5332,46359,"As the previous post said just google it. Another great way is through bridal magazines- even if it's not on a subject specifically on ""hair"" just look throughout every page only at the hair on the bride- people usually just skim the pages only looking for subjects based on the particular topic they are looking for but you can get great hair, make/up, accessory ideas on any page just look for the details! good luck!"
5179,47234,"My hubby and I went on a cruise through Royal Caribbean cruise lines, and it was absolutely fantastic.  Food and activities are included.  If you want alcohol or shore excursions they are extra, but there is so much to do.  A balcony room was very romantic for us to be able to have breakfast overlooking the water in the privacy of our own room and we never heard a peep from our neighbors.  You can go on a cruise for way under $6,000 or you can get a really fancy suite for that much!  Consider it, we had a wonderful time (they even have a newlywed reception with the captain and champagne) "
5202,47234,"I faced the same problem you did.  For my out of town bridesmaids (2), who were in Iowa (I am in NY) I gave them all Visa Gift Cards with $300 on them to help with expenses related to getting out here (I think they both used it for airfare).  This way I could be sure they would be able to share the day with me.  If there are several people coming from one area and you are within a day or 2 driving distance, help hook them up with each other and see if they would be willing to carpool to save money on gas.

Other tricks I used: Send your save the dates very far in advance, that way people who really want to come will be able to budget and plan.  Last minute does not work for big travel expenses!  Above all, know that just because someone can't make it does not mean they do not want to.  Go easy of relatives and friends who cannot afford the trip but tell you that they want to.  Your day will be perfect no matter who is there as long and you and your new hubby are!"

5306,47284,"I disagree--this is your day!  I think that if your MOH isn't going to consider how stressful this may be for you & at least step up to the plate & help a little then she doesn't deserve it.  Your bridesmaid that is there for you & helping you all along the way is the HONORABLE one.  She should be honored in your ceremony by being your MOH.  I'm sure your MOH has her own life & things going on that are probably valid, but this is only (supposed to) happen once in your life and the fact that you honored her with MOH should mean a lot to her!  I don't think she's appreciating you & your bridesmaid deserves the honors."
5370,39625,"If I were you, mail them back an invitation, and let them know that you were expecting higher quality, and that you expect as an American Wedding Company they do the right thing by reprinting your invitations!

Also, half the time you don't really save that much money ordering online, if you go to stationary stores and give them a budget and an amount of invitations you need their willing to work with you and make you happy!

They are knee length, strapless dresses but very pretty.  I am using them in my wedding (August).  They are definitely dresses the girls can wear again and not some that will go straight to the back of their closets.  I think your color scheme sounds great!  Try looking at the flower Dhalia.  It comes in lots of shapes and colors...a great alternative to the traditional roses you see at every wedding."

As an invitation and RSVP specialist...I am leary of giving invitations to family members to give out or address....it always ends up that they will need additional invites because they have ended giving invitations to people who were not initially in the count.  Keep it simple and hire a company so that she does not feel slighted.

Bottom line is your sweetie loves you for who you are.
I disagree with the first poster. Do not put off your wedding. I do agree however that you need to have a chat with your fiance. Tell him your feelings and how this bothers you. He needs to step up to the plate and say something to his family. He can not force them to like you, however he can demand their respect on his decision to marry you. He needs to tell them you are what makes him happy and that should be enough for them.Bottom line when you marry, you are also marring the others persons family. This will be a issue you have to deal with for the rest of your life. You need to decide if this is something you are prepared to deal with before saying I do.

5276,22715,"I am a wedding planner who's prices are geared to everyday people such as your self. Favors are not a rule of thumb, but expected. There are several ways of doing this in a affordable way. Make things your self, home made choc. candy, mini pic frames with a special note of thanks or poem inside, check on line if you order things in bulk its much more cost effective. Or go the old fashioned way. Heard of the penny under the chair? Go to the dollar store, get some nice candles and silk flowers, make a nice centerpiece, one for each table. Place a penny under one chair per table, the person who sits in that chair gets to take home the centerpiece. This kills 2 birds with one stone, centerpieces as well as favors. Naturally you do not have to use dollar store candles, you can use anything realy, be creative and shop around.
Cut back on cost elsewhere. Food, maybe do a buffet style, cake, serve cup cakes, or a desert bar, make the desserts your self, this will give you more $ to play with.

I also have had a bride who instead of doing the traditional names and date on the bev naps, they purchased a Irish friendship ring stamp, with a nice poem. and did the napkins her self. This still gave the personal feel, but it was different from every other wedding.

First of all, since you are having a destination wedding and you won't be able to have a run through, it might be best to do it yourself. That being said, I would suggest your approach be two fold. First, schedule with a makeup artist in your area to take a trip to the local Sephora, for instance. He or she can go over products that are appropriate for the occasion, and will work specifically for you. Secondly, schedule another appointment with that Makeup Artist to go over and apply all of the products that you are planning on using that day. He or she can watch and help you apply the products in a way that will flattering for your wedding day. Also take copious notes and use a face chart.
This will hopefully give a definite sense of control on your wedding day, but you will have excellent professional input, which will prove invaluable. Good Luck!"

Even the spreads in the wedding magazines that go for a natural look are using far more makeup than we do in our day to day life.  I think you should make an appointment and stress that you want to go with natural shades.  Look through wedding and fashion magazines to find a look that you like.  Make the appontment with a little cushion of time.  Remember that even if you absolutely hate what they've done, you don't have to stick with it.  You might have wasted some money (I know we're all on budgets), but the absulute worst case scenario is that you end up applying your own makeup anyway.  If you can find it, Summer 2007 In Style Weddings did natural makeup, using Willa Ford as a model.  Best of luck, I'm sure you'll look gorgeous no matter what."
5306,45447,"I graduated from law school in May and my best friend was scheduled to get married on June 29.  While I was thrilled to serve as her MOH, I was studying for the 2nd hardest Bar exam in the country, and I was decidedly broke.  You knew when you asked your MOH that she lived out of town.  What you have to understand is that she does have a life and obligations independent of your impending nuptuals.  She's already plunking down a rather large amount of money for the honor of being your attendant.  Coming in from out of town, adds to that expense.  It's only natural that the local bridesmaid is in a better position to help with everything.  The question is, do you want to choose your MOH based on who's available, or based on who has been your best friend.  My advice is to stick with the original impulse that led you to ask your friend to be MOH.  Arrange for her to have her dress fitting in her home town (as is normal) and don't jeopardize a valuable friendship."
5415,8287,"Have you thought about her having another role?  Hostess, a reading, etc.?  The final decision is you and your future fiance.  You would like to have faces reflected in your bridal party of people that the both of you want to share in your special day and that you all share a bound of memories and love.  Never feel obligated to put someone in your wedding because they are family or the family is putting pressure on you.

WHen the both of you have made a decision (the first of many) stand by it and the both of you make it clear to the sister and his family."

I actually make wedding favors tags, to go with your favors. I use thick italian paper, and charge .50 cents a tag (when you order at least 25 tags) + shipping. You just let me know colors and shape, and choice of ribbon! I can make proofs online, send you a sample, and go from there.
Let me know if you're interested!
Good Luck,

5372,39625,"To be completely honest, my dad gave me a dress budget and told me to stick to it. Then he surprised me with an extra amount for accesories and such! You can do the same with your significant other, and leave a few hundred out, so you can surprise her with a little extra to let her play around with hair pins, veils, shoes and undergarments.
Good Luck!"

I hope your planning is going great! I make wedding invitations that can be created by you.  Let me know if I can help.

5370,42429,"I am so sorry to hear about your horrible experience.  You should let the company know that you are not satisfied with the product and will not tolerate their lack of customer service.  
As an invitation designer and maker, it is important to receive feedback from clients.  If there is anything I can do for you please let me know.  All my invitations are made personally by me.  "

1926,42429,"My day job is a Dental Hygienist, so hopefully this helps.  
The Crest White Strips are the best over the counter product out there right now.  Get the 30 minute ones not the 5 minute ones.  You can experience sensitivity because it's a one size fits all type of strip, but it will go away within 24 hours 
The best way to go is to have custom made trays at a dental office.  These should cost anywhere from $100 and up.  
Either way you go, whiten about 2-3 weeks before the wedding, and definitely not the night before because if you do experience sensitivity you don't want to experience on your weding day!
Please let me know if you have any other questions.  "

In this situation, it is hard to imagine that they would select identical dresses but they would all glow because they feel good.  Any store or website that sells women's clothes these days sells dresses that could double as bridesmaids dresses - even Target!  "
5454,46392,"It is not tacky at all to send them out with your invitations to your shower. I would definitely do that. Its especially nice if your name is on the card because some people like to take those with to the store if they are uncertain of the spelling of your name. "
5361,46106,"I used a reception to follow line.  It just seemed silly to have reception cards since our reception is just upstairs from our ceremony, but like you said, I definitely wanted people to know we're feeding them.

For whatever it's worth, I ordered my invites from <a href=""http://www.theamericanwedding.com"">theamericanwedding.com</a>.  The guy on the phone (I had foreign language accents, so ended up calling) was so so nice and spent a lot of time with me.  He said reception to follow is totally normal, which eased my stress a lot. 

Hope that helps!"
5438,46392,"Typically, no. There are many factors that have to come in to play. First, how long you've been divorced. I think i've heard before if you've been divorced longer than 5 years a shower would be appropriate. Secondly, according to etiquette the purpose of having a shower is for a couple to receive things for your new home together, it is assumed that the couple would just be starting out on their own, of course times have changed but thats the history, considering you both have been married 2-3 times people might consider it to be selfish or greedy. Third, for 2nd and 3rd weddings, it's not typical for couples to follow the same traditions of 1st marriages.  For instance, they are usually smaller..a bride may not wear a white dress, etc. Do know that I have heard of other gatherings where gifts aren't ""expected"" or ""required"" therefore, maybe you can have something to honor your new love and upcoming wedding rather than expect gifts. I hope this helps! "
5456,21205,"Wow that could be a problem, but you could as your mom and step dad to walk you down the aisle, but if you are only considering one, i would say chose your mom.  she has been there for you your whole entire life, raising you (and your brothers) by herself.  I was also raised by a single mom and if my dad were to walk back in my life i would still have my mom walk me down the aisle."
5464,21205,"Im personally not doing it, but I dont see my fiancee that often. But thats not a bad idea.  If your fiancee loves you enough, he wont go out and cheat.  This is your relationship is about you and your fiancee, not you, your fiancee and your family.  Someone is alway going to have a negative opinion no matter what you do, so just go with whatever feels right with you."

5441,26876,"I had a bilingual ceremony too. What we did was the prayers in Spanish and everything else in English. Maybe you can do the same, but the opposite, the prayers in English, and everything else in Spanish. Or vice versa."
5464,26876,"I did the same, but we stopped about 6mos. prior. I think that this will open up many other ways to connect with your fiance. And, about the whole cheating thing, if he were to, then you know it wasn't meant to be. If you feel strong about it, and you fiance does as well, stick to it. And imagine the anticipation, it'll be worth it on the honeymoon. Good Luck! "
5454,26876,"what we did was we used tiny label stickers and typed where we were registered we stuck them on the card with the directions with our Invitaions (wedding). I really wouldn't find it rude to find a registry insert in a wedding invitation, because nowadays most people bring gifts anyway and it would make it easier for me rather than have to do research to figure out if the couple registerd anywhere or not. So if you don't want to mail the inserts out you can do similar to what I did. Sending them with the Shower invites, is good, but not everyone that you invite to the wedding will you invite to the shower right? So, not everyone would get one. Good Luck!"
5469,26876,"You want you bridesmaids and groomsmen to compliment each other, but you also, want your grooms tux to be along the lines of your groomsmen as well. My girls wore either black, or apple red and black. The groomsment wore, black and apple red. My dress was white and claret red, my husband wore a white tux with claret red vest and tie, so we all complimented each other. You'll want to avoid a lot of different color mixes. I think a white tux with pink vest and tie, will tie all the colors in, he will match with the groomsmen, as far as the vest and tie, and also with the girls, and he will match with you. You won't wash each other out, check out my picture so you have an idea, I have more in my slide show."
5461,8287,"A cash bar can be open for as long as your event.  Etiquette states that if you invited the person to your house for a party you wouldn't ask them to pay for their drinks and so should be the concept for your wedding (which is a bigger party)  The choice is always yours but make your guests aware of the cash bar so they are not blindsided when they arrive at the reception. (This is not information you would put on yout invitation)  The Guest Book offers RSVP service and this service verbally tells the guests any information you want them to know about your wedding as well as collect the RSVP's for your event.

5454,8287,"Etiquette states that the registry information should not be placed in the invitation because you are telling your guests to give you a gift.  Now although that is the concept let it not ""show"" that intent.

My company does offer a service that when guests RSVP for an event we advise them of where the couple is registered.

She dressed her mom (bought the dress and decided on her look)  When she was about to walk down the aisle, she asked for her mother and when her mom came to see what was ""wrong"" she turned to her and asked her to walk her down the aisle....the mom was so overwhlemed....she cried all the way down the aisle."

I have been with my fiance for a long time, his mother and my family are long time friends. My fiance mother (father is deceased) does not care for me and I dont care for her.  After all, she is not the best person in the world to get along with. As long as there is a respect factor that's all that matters.  My FH knows the relationship between me and his mom.  His statement to me was:  You are marrying me NOT us.  As long as you all respect each other thats all I can expect.

Both my stepdad (i've known him for 25 years) and dad walked me down the aisle, with both walking half way, my stepdad kissed me and shook my dad's hand and then went up front to watch the rest of the ceremony. My dad then continued on to give me away.

Here's my suggestion - as uncomfortable as it was, we both sat down with all of our parents individually and told them they don't have to like each other or even talk to each other, but if they are going to in any way make us uncomfortable on our day they didn't have to come.  All parents sat at different tables at the reception.  And guess what - my mom and step-mom are like best friends now - after 25 years!!

My name is Lisa Teeter and I am an Area Manager for Arbonne International. I would recommend taking a look at our Figure 8 Weightloss Plan at www.PureSwissSkincare4u.myarbonne.com. Our weight loss system has proven results and doesn't leave you jittery or feeling like your missing out. It provides you with the tools you need to successfully lose weight and boost your metabolism. My husband and I did the Figure 8 Weight Loss plan together and we supported one another to our weight loss goals. I lost 25 pounds and he lost 38 pounds. 

I would love to chat with you about all our wedding services. We offer Spa parties with Sea Salt Scrub for hands, mini-manicures, facials, deep tissue massage, makeovers and foot scrub and soaks. Our products are Swiss formulated and botanically based and our products are results driven which means they really do what they say they do. We offer a business opportunity to offset the high costs associated with planning a wedding.

55,47697,"Hello -
I am an Area Manager for Arbonne International and a lot of brides host a Spa Party for their bridesmaids so they can spend quality time together before the big event. We bring spa stations for the gals to move through: Deep Tissue Massages, Mini-Manicures, Sea Salt Scrub Station, foot scrub and soak, Facials and Mini-Makeovers. 

We bring a bartender with us and all the fixins for a really fun time that is relaxing and rejuvenating as well as a fun time for everyone. The bridesmaids take home an Awaken Sea Salt Scrub or a Hand Cream with them at the end of the party. I have even been asked on many occasions to do Sea Salt Scrubs at the actual Wedding Reception for the guests. People love them and it just adds a unique and awesome touch to the wedding that people remember. I also do Beauty Gift baskets filled with skincare and cosmetics for the bridesmaids. It's the ultimate thank you gift for the gals who are closest to you.

5127,44075,"Mom, I think its wonderful of you to want to do this for your children. Here's what your trying to get accomplished: You want to celebrate their union and allow your friends and family to be privy to that. Instead of a shower, I would throw them a reception in April (on their 6mo anniversary) That way you can give your children the best gift of all, the wedding reception they deserve. In having a reception, that should be suggestion enough for gifts to be offered. Good Luck and congratulations mom!"

And if the case is that you did, you may just want to send them an invitation for after dinner, for the cake, champagne toast, and music. This way there's no hard feelings.

5480,26876,"You should first look into what the courthouse will permit, Make sure how many guest you are allowed, are flowers allowed? I pretty sure you can have pictures, but double check on that. You have to also remember that there maybe other other ceremonies prior of after, and I am assuming they are by appointment, so you may even have a time constraint. You need to do some research and find out whats is and whats not allowed. Have you considered having an officiant come to you? That way you can find maybe even a park or backyard(if you have one) and you can do it there. "
5464,15019,"I think this is great! I don't want to get to deep into your business but of the women you asked who is happily Married? Be careful of who you pose questions to, including family. I've learned that what's done in the dark will come to the light, so just focus on the next five months of planning your nuptials. "
5464,18608,"I think it is a wonderful idea and very full of love.  We have thought about doing the same thing, so if you can do it then yeah thats awesome for the both of you and your wedding night will be all the more amazing.  As for cheating puulease, come on thats crazy!  He has already tasted the milk and has made a huge commitment by asking you to share his life.  I firmly believe if he is meant to cheat then he will, but you of all the people in the world know him the best, so all in all go with what your gut says.  Great luck to you in your wedding plans, have fun."

5495,39625,"Oh dear, well first things first - if your truly unhappy with the navy dress, figure out what your budget is to replace it with something that you'll love. You know you could always find a simple white gown that you love, for the ceremony, and after dinner - before the cake you can surprise everyone by changing into the more comfortable Navy Gown. This way it doesn't go to waste and you get to show off how great it is! Good Luck!"
5307,48246,"How about the best of both worlds? Schedule a makeup 'bridal' lesson and get tips and tricks on how to do your makeup yourself. That way, you feel more confident about doing it on your big day and even take pictures during/after your lesson to see how it translates.  That way you avoid the dreaded 'drag queen' look and you learn some cool tips and tricks and you are confident in doing it yourself which sounds like what you really would rather do anyway... just a thought! best of luck!!"
5372,16290,"As the mother of a recent bride, we told our daughter that her dress would be our gift to her, but to please be reasonable.

She only paid $500.00 for it and it looked fabulous.  -- Jane "
5463,35271,"There are very few places in the DFW area that are less than $600 to rent. To cut your cost though, you might consider getting married on a Friday or Sunday. They are typically cheaper not only for the venue rental but your other vendors as well. I would also suggest looking for a venue where you can bring in your own catering and alcohol. This typically can save you more money than a venue with on site catering. Goodluck and Congratulations!!"
5495,39625,"oh also, CocoMyles does a Maternity Wear dress. You might want to look there, and order color swatches. Lengths go from knee length to long, starts at $120 to $125, and if your bridesmaids are purchasing their own dresses you can always just let them know where to go and what colors you would like!"
5409,29587,"Bubbles when you leave the reception is a great idea!  (Assuming you're leaving and not staying the night there)  The drawbacks?  There may not be many people there to see it and participate.   And if it's late at night, the photo op might not be as great as you envisioned.

Have you considered dried lavender or silk flower petals that can be thrown as you are leaving the altar?  Both are easily swept up, won't harm animals and make for fabulous photos!  I've seen brides hang paper cones on chairs filled with the petals and a note about what to do with them  :)"

5517,26876,"For my wedding our videoagrapher filmed from start to finish, but in our DVD he presented only the highlights of the day, ceremony, picture(some), us being introduced at reception, first dance, cake cutting, garter and bouquet toss, some dancing, and us leaving. Oh and also some guest interviews. It was about 60 min long and gave us a good feel for the day. They also gave us the raw footage incase we ever wanted to see it all in its entirety(sp*). We got media studies students from a nearby college to do it for very cheap! And it turned out pretty good. If you already have a photographer and you are spending quite a bit on them, consider craigslist, put a post specifically for students or someone with the right equiptment and willingness to do it. Im pretty sure you'll get some other post saying ""nooooo"" but I did it and I have a video of my day and no complaints. Good luck!! I hope this helps."

5530,42429,"Hi Marta!

I think it depends on how many different foods you want to serve.  If you are going to have 2 main dishes with the same sides, then sit down would be nice. If you are going to have multiple selections, then buffet is better.
At our wedding for 250 people, it was easier to do buffet.  We had vegetarians, people who didn't eat seafood, others with allergies.  With a buffet we served a chicken, beef, seafood, vegetarian and 3 selections of side dishes along with salad and rolls.  
Hope this helps.  "
5485,42429,"Same thing happened to us, even after the wedding!  Tell them that you aren't sure if it's going to be a big function or just family.  If they aren't family then they can't expect an invitation.  You can also say you are on a budget and trying to keep it small, everyone understands money - although people who haven't gotten married don't really understand how much a wedding costs! Good luck.
Hope this helps."
5461,5074,"Etiquette dictates that it is in bad taste to invite your guests to your wedding but make them pay for their own drinks. A suggestion would be to offer beer, wine and soft drinks. If a guest chooses not to drink any of the offered (FREE) drinks, he then has the option to pay for what he wants. "

5522,39625,"An outdoor wedding is perfect since there isn't much to do. I'm assuming you aren't holding the reception there, so there's no need for tables and such. If you love candles try and find mini vases to put tea light candles in. Or you can get a wrought iron garden stand and put some on each side, to make an aisle. The neat thing about those, is that they aren't expensive and you can get floral garland or tulle if you like to decorate them. Or you can always go the ""wedding arch way"" Those are really pretty, you can be married under it and once again if you want to decorate it you can use floral garland. Also if you would like rice or something of that sort to be thrown, it might be an easier thing to get grass seeds, and have your guests throw that..same sizes as rice, and there's nothing to clean :)

5532,45992,"Hi Being Polite,

As a wedding professional I recommend that you only invite your special and close friends...Have them over for a small gathering and announce your wedding plans. Make sure you let them know that they are all invited and you would love to have them there. Perhaps someone in your group knows a Travel Agent who can put together a really good package deal for your wedding party. 

Brain storm and ask your friends for ideas.  Be open and listen to their ideas and don't be to critical or shoot down their ideas. They are ""Their"" ideas and you don't have to use them. 

Once you have done this collect the top three and you and your fiance decide which idea best suites your plans.

Wishing you the best.

55,48410,"Greetings,

I am a representative for Bs Purses, and think that cute, sassy bags are a great gift and the bridesmaids will get a lot of mileage and use of these great, cute bags. 

Bs Purses are fashionable, fun, and totally customizable.  You can CUSTOMIZE purses, totes, business portfolios, diaper bags, back packs, luggage, cosmetic bags, with a wide selection of colors, fabrics, ribbon & trim, handles, shapes and sizes plus monogramming.

Great idea if your bridesmaids love houndstooth, leopard, or retro polka dots.  You can order online or schedule a purse party where your friends can come and see examples of bags, and I'll have refreshments, music, etc. anything you would like to customize your party.  Here is the information on how it works and how to order:

5532,26876,"My family got an invitation like that. I think on the response card it said the restuarant they chose and the type of cuisine they served, and also if they should make reservations on theier behalf. I think you should definately leave out the work reception, and work in wedding dinner, you may get some questioning by your guests but I dont think it would be polite to say directly on an invitation you have to pay for your own meal. Also, since you are expecting your guests to pay for their own meal, are you going to expect wedding gifts? "
5526,39625,"Since you are doing a Vegetarian Menu a buffet would be best, so you can let your guests pick and choose. You could always get different lasagnas, risottos, stir fry,  and  mini appetizers made in a vegetarian way. Also you can have very filling salads garnished with fruits and such. You can also have Paninni style sandwiches, like feta cheese and tomato.
Also you can make different styles of lasagna, mushroom, three cheese, eggplant, ect. Same for the risotto, and as appetizers you can make interesting vegetarian ones, like figs on cream cheese over thin slices of baguette. Try to surprise your guests with a versatile vegetarian menu. People always assume that if it's vegetarian it has no flavor or interesting concept!
Best of Luck!"
5530,26876,"I guess that depends on your budget. There is a big difference in prices for a sit down and buffet. I had a buffet reception and it wasn't tacky at all, as a matter of fact it was much appreciated, because that way you chose how much you want on your plate. Sit down dinners normally you get what you get, and if its not enough too bad. you can expect sit downs to be alot more than a buffet. So i guess it more or less depends on your budget as well as your taste."
5032,45992,"Tea length dresses are nice. If you get into a grind you might want to pick out three styles that compliment a different body type( be tastful the plunging neck line is not a very good look on some) Compliment: meaning fits well and is comfortable. After you have picked out the three style of dresses have your girls go and try them on and as long as they are the same color (black) your girls are happy with the way the dress fits and would most likely use the dress again. "
5443,39625,"If you're having a reception, you can always have a brunch or lunch reception, it cuts cost if that's an issue. And just because it's December doesn't mean you can only do a snowflake theme so explore your themes. White and Metallics are great for a winter wedding. Also you may want to try a heavier cake, like a cherry cheese cake. Something that's perfect for winter and not overwhelming like chocolate. Also because it's a rich cake, a smaller one is perfect to feed MANY guests. For invitations you can also go with the white and metallic theme, they compliment each other so well.
Good Luck!"
5307,45992,"Your Make up is important. Make sure you let the make up artist know what you want. Have them do a trial run. You should wear foundation and cover up. This is important for the finished look. Make sure that the make-up artist gives you a touch up kit. Small amount of make up that you can apply if needed and deffinately lipstick and gloss what ever your preference. Best Wishes.  "
5393,45992,"Mother In-Laws are important. Yes, you should allow her something to do. The invites No, like the answer before this one. To have better control over the attendance have your mother In-law give you the addresses and you can hire someone to do them or you do them yourself. Best of luck!

5133,45992,"You should explain to the key people that your parents are not going to be there...especially the photographer. When asking for the families to gather around for photos, its nice to know whos who so one does not make the mistake of assuming who your parents are. You can do this at the time of your meeting and of course you don't have to tell them why. Just let them know the important people you will be photographed with.

I share the same situation my parents were not there for my wedding for the same reason...God is Amazing he kept you as he did me from going down that path. You have many reasons not to be sad one is you found an awsome person to love, your fiance.

5495,4007,"MindyTwirl is right (listen to the girl - she's got great ideas!)I love the idea of 2 dresses! I had a client who wore a navy dress for her (seaside, piratey) wedding & my caution to her was to make sure the style was sufficiently bride-y and different from the other so that no one would have to ask who the bride was. She looked beautiful & there was no question she was the bride. I created a larger trailing bouquet with opulent peacock feathers & seashells in it.
Re: the MOH - what about a silvery smoky blue with navy accents?"
5519,4007,"I go quite often to the Mexican Caribbean, just 50 -100 miles miles north of there. A good site to look at (& ask questions) is www.locogringo.com. Look in the forums section. BTW - the Mexico side seems to have better deals on flights & accomodations from what I've seen. Also, the last hurrican season made a fairly direct hit near the mexico-belize border, so be sure to check that your chosen accomodation has been repaired (if damaged.)"
5532,4007,"Well, you can't politely invite people to pay for their own dinner (its like inviting people to christmas dinner bu expecting them to bring their own meal) - the host of a party provides the appropriate meal. Of course, a cake and punch/champagne reception is a perfectly appropriate meal for a mid afternoon wedding, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
On the other point, no should expect you to pay their travel expenses. "

5544,21232,"I've ordered mine online from here: http://www.budgetweddinginvitations.com/
I can't tell you how they look just yet since they haven't arrived, but I only bought some of my invites from there (75 of them). The people I don't see actually flying in and coming to my wedding, I'm printing those out (which is about 50). I got the invitation kit from Michaels:  http://www.michaels.com/art/online/displayProductPage?productNum=wd0174&channelid=.  I went to the actual story though and bought them. I didn't order them online."
5544,39625,"I actually suggest coming up with a budget, and going to a stationary store.
Let them know your budget, and how many invitations you need. They are always willing to work with you, and show you tons of things in your price range. Also most places charge 35-45$ for an assembling fee, they will let you know if you can assemble them yourself to save money. 

I hope you go to a stationary store, ordering invitations online never look the same in person. Plus in store, you can go and visit to make sure everything is being done right..samples, colors, shapes, sizes, fonts, ect. Plus the store cares about the end product, they aren't going to give you invitations they don't like. And if theirs any changes needed they will work with you.
Good Luck!"
5545,21205,"well that depends on how bold you want the colors. you could go with pastels (yellow, lavender) or go with the deeper colors (royal purple and canary yellow). My personal opinion would be to go with the deeper colors because you mainly use the pastels during the Easter holiday.  But either set would work for a May wedding.  Good luck and I hope this helps!!!"
5519,30016,"For snorkeling and diving, I would head to a coastal town called Placencia... Spent part of our honeymoon there. "
5543,39625,"Instead of place cards, use 1 table card, you can fine tons of pictures of 1920's-1930's magazine covers online, have them printed on heavy paper, and use those, have a name or number for each one. It's silly but neat, for example:

Theme colors could be washed out purple, sepia, black, white, pearl with red accents of some sort.

Centerpieces could be vases filled with pearls, jewels, or tall feathers. To purchase some of those things check this site out http://www.save-on-crafts.com/index.html

THE CEREMONY AND RECEPTION WILL BE IN THE SAME PLACE .MY CONCERN IS THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. WE BOTH HAVE SMALL FAMILIES. WE ARE INVITING NO MORE THAN 100. i REALLY WANT A BAND BUT IS IT WORTH IT?

5438,8287,"I agree"
5544,21205,"I actually bought mine from a wedding superstore in Dallas (150 for $85, but they are DIY).  Depending on how much you want to spend, I dont know if there are any cheap ones that come already printed.  orientaltrading.com has some really cute invitations and so do alot of arts and crafts stores like Michael's and Hobby Lobby.  Hope this helps!!!"
5545,39625,"Spring is perfect for pastels. I always go to flowers to help me with colors, so I'll try and do the same for you. Violet Lilac 'Sensation', their beautiful, fragrant and inexpensive. Lavender Sweet Pea are simple but very pretty. Lavender stems are beautiful too, and very fragrant. The Dreaming Maid tulip has lavender petals and its tipped with white, it's very romantic. Then their are Lavender Spider Chrysanthemum which last long and are inexpensive.
Yellow is beautiful but it really pops so you may want to try Whites and Greens or Pinks. also if you like to use yellow, There's a pink flower with yellow accents Alstroemeria 'Capri' it's absolutely gorgeous, there's multiple flowers on a stem. Anywho good luck, hope this was helpful. Best thing to do is head to a florist, and get a bunch of flowers you like and use that as a theme. That way you know what's available.
"
5532,8287,"Nikki Jovan, a reception is a receiving of your guests.  If you are not able to do so, guest what?  It's okay...there is nothing wrong with inviting guests to a nice ceremony and then the bride and groom have a receiving line and then are whisked off to their honeymoon.  It is not the norm but long ago receptions were mere cake and punch and now they are produtions that loans are taken out for.  I would rather be invited to a ceremony than be invited to a reception where I have to pay for my own meal.  And as someone mentioned, would you also expect a gift?"
5546,39625,"My dear, as someone whose having three weddings to make everyone happy you've put up your question on the right site. Since you do not want to offend your family, ask them straight out if they would prefer to do a completely separate reception, the day after or week later. And the second reception can be something simple like a garden reception at yours or your parents home where you can wear your wedding dress a second time. To add a bonus let your parents take care of everything, food, time, decorations and such if they would like. You would just send out 2 different invitations, one to his family with instructions of a reception to follow, and one to your family with instructions of a reception to follow at the later date you choose. No one will be offended that you took their religious views into consideration to make them feel comfortable and get to share your day. Don't be worried, if anything people will be glad that you actually cared!"
5546,8287,"In all fairness to you and your groom, planning seperate receptions if that is not what you want don't do it.  I understand about religious guests because when I got married 4 years ago my guests were half and half.  We chose not have any alcohol (WE...the bride and groom) and if people had to have a drink then they were more than welcome to seek out the hotel bar for a drink on their own tab.

Also we had a song, toasts, garter and bouquet toss and then we danced the night away.  Work with your DJ with regard to music...play soft jazz music throughout the evening (no words of course) go through an entire program and then once you have done your thank yous at the end have the DJ mildly blend in the music.  Your religious crowd will leave....believe me....My guests enjoyed themselves because they were able to enjoy the reception in its entirety and then when the ""worldly"" part of the program kicked into high gear they dissappeared.  Noone felt slighted and noone was offended.


"
5544,32746,"I really like www.invitesite.com because they do environmentally friendly invitations that are also really beautiful.

They can send you the invites to assemble yourself and they give you the option of printing yourself or they can do it for you.

I think their prices are really good. 

Going to a stationary store with your budget is also a great idea."

5548,39625,"Yes it is more than ok to have a bridal shower, in the end everyone gets to celebrate with you. Send separate invitations. Send the ones for Greece as a normal wedding invitation. And send a second invitation as a Meet Mr. & Mrs., ect to reception.   I'm doing the same since I'm having 3 weddings, and our last one is really just a reception. Our wording is very formal since it's a formal Reception, but I'll write it below so you can see.
To Meet
Mr. and Mrs. his name

Mr. and Mrs. my parents name (they are hosting)
request the pleasure of your company at a 
Brunch Reception

This was what our printer said was proper etiquette and our invitations turned out beautifully. So good luck and hope it was helpful."
5552,21232,"Just a suggestion, you should look for a bridal show.  I just went to one in Houston the Bridalextravaganza and got my Style: T9218 from David Bridal there. That was my dream dress.  There was a discount and then I got to spin the wheel and won another $30.00 discount for it.  So, all in all, I think I saved about $70.00.  It's early enough in the year to see if there is something like that in your area.  Go check it out and get some discounts."
235,21232,"Hey, just wanted to know what your decision was after these several months. I was just browing though discussions and rung across this one.  My fiance was hooked on WOW (War of Warcraft) like the person below had stated. He gave it up Feb 2006 and hasn't played it since. He now plays Team Fortress 2, but we compromised days to do things that I want to do. In the summer, we go do outdoor activities. My first husband, however, was constantly on his computer too, which also meant No Sex. Not even a kiss!  I divorced him, being really scared that I would be alone, but that experience with my first husband made me realized how miserable I was, and that I would rather be miserable alone. I didn't think I would ever say that outloud, I always said I rather be miserable WITH someone than alone, but I've changed that opinion.  Bottom line...FIGHT for your happiness. Don't be afraid to leave if you have to. There WILL be someone else. I divorced in 2004 and now will marry again in 2008."
5485,46106,"We're having that problem, too.  People get a little crazy about weddings.  Even people who have shown no interest in us or our lives in the past decade seem to think they should be guests of honor!  Most people have accepted the explanation that our little ceremony is for immediate family only.  One person had a different definition of ""immediate"" and said he was going to come whether we invited him or not!  Since our would-be crasher was on my fiancé's side, he made a phone call and explained that it's a very small ceremony and that we had to limit the guest list, but that doesn't at all mean we have bad feelings about him. It didn't go over especially well, but it was the best thing we could think of to do.  "
5160,46106,"We handled it exactly the same as ElizMary.  Bio- and step- we have 8 parents coming - 3 couples and 2 singles.  In the mix are several rather incendiary combinations.  Most of the talks went well.  A couple did not, but we did it early enough that they've had some time to cool off.  We were very careful with the seating arrangements, and I'm feeling pretty confident about it.  Of course, the wedding hasn't happened yet, so we'll see how it goes when the big day arrives."
4433,46106,"I have to second the objection to ""legally"" they have the same name.  Changing your name is totally separate from getting married.  Personally, I would be offended if someone called me by my husband's name, as I don't plan to change mine.  Why would someone I know send an invitation to someone who is not me?  I think Mr.____ & Ms. (or Mrs.) _______ is the way to go."
5464,18635,"After getting engaged shouldn't be when you and your fiancee decide to connect on another level.  That should have already been established, prior to this point.  The getting pregnant part I understand.  BUT if you do get pregnant, which we all know with proper precautions is effective (I know NOT 100%),it is what it is.  The fairytale princess gown may be a wrap but we know the consequences.  

I agree with the poster that said...""Are the women you spoke to HAPPILY married?""  That is very important.  

ANother question...This goes back to a previous post of yours.  You know what your future husband decided about one of your bridesmaid without your consent.  You didn't seem to like that.  

Big Picture...Look at EVERYTHING that has gone on and that is going on.  Be true to you and who you are.  

Listen...My thoughts are realistic and logical not fantasy.  Sorry about being so blunt.  Hope this helps."
5530,18635,"Well I agree with the other commments.  Now mind you the price depends on the place.  For us, sit-down and buffet are the same price.  The difference is the amount of food you get.  You want your guests to be happy."
5545,26876,"This question comes up quite often here, but yellow and purple are a nice combo if you decide with those. You can also search previous post regarding colors, there have been many great suggestions in the past. "
5546,26876,"I sort of had the same problem, but I managed to have some alcohol present and dancing. And believe me some of guests did leave as soon as the music started, my mother in law just sat in a corner for the rest of the night. But anyway, do you have to have the alcohol and music? If so then consider maybe wine instead of having hard liqour. I find wine isant as offensive as hard liqour, and then have someone play a piano(if possible) or violin solo during dinner, and slowly change up the tempo if you have a DJ. I guess the main thing is if you want to get your party on, go ahead. you only get married once and you should do whatever you want to make it extra special for you. If people leave, don't feel bad, thats their decision not yours. Don't pressure your dad though, even its Your day, you still need to be respectful of your dads wishes. Good luck"

You might try this site: www.finestationery.com

They've expensive and fancy invitations, and the more traditional and elegant invitations that are, strangely enough, less expensive. 

Great online typesetting for entering wording and even have fill in the blank style wording suggestions.

Ordered 100 printed invitations with double envelopes for $113.80.  That includes shipping, tax and a $10.00 fee for a proof.

Did RSVPs on postcards created on printsmadeeasy.com. Something unusual and less expensive in postage. Did discreet front design & custom back on a plain background.  Their online customizer is a bit more challenging to figure out, but easy to use once you do. 100 for $38.99.

I did go into a stationery store once I figured out what style and type of invitation I wanted.  This let me touch,feel, see sizes and ask questions. Then I went back online and ""wahoo - viola!"":-)

5575,42429,"Hi!
This might help.  For clothes, you don't have to use the traditional wedding gown. Maybe go to a store you like to shop at and look at their dresses - you might find something you like that's your style yet elegant for a ""wedding"" dress.  
As for the ceremony and reception sites, I would go based on the weather at the time of the wedding.  I'm not from the East Coast, so I don't know the details of the climate, bugs, humidity, etc.. If the bugs come out at night or it gets humid in the afternoon, maybe just have the ceremony outside and reception inside. 
Hope this helps."
5546,21407,"I had the very same problem and this is what I did. I got married at 1:00 p.m. and had a family dinner in a room at the same place I was having an evening reception. The family dinner was a sit down meal, and the evening reception which started at 6:00 was buffet style with food stations located in different areas all over the room, because I hate lineups. On my invitations I wrote words to this effect. ""Following a private family ceremony, the honour of your presence is requested at a dinner/reception"" etc.  The family dinner for 30 or so was intimate and touching, and the evening reception was a blast. We danced, laughed, and had a great time with over 100 guests. Because we had both receptions at the same place we got a very good deal. Some of my friends came to the church to see the ceremony anyway, which they are welcome to, and then came later to the evening reception.  Everyone was happy. "

5464,31333,"My boyfriend and I have talked about that once we become officially engaged.  I agree with one of the previous responses: if he cheats, it wasn't meant to be.  It will hopefully help strengthen your relationship.  Go for it!  It's better to find out now whether or not you do have the communication you need to really connect than wait until after you get married.  It will help you be more intimate with each other before and after your union."
3518,31333,"I would definitely put mine in the living room.  It would be extra special probably if you put some smaller, more everyday pictures of you and your husband around it.  Like maybe your engagement photo if you have one, along with maybe a picture from Christmas or one at a park or something.  Have some fun playing around with arrangements on the wall.  Everyone will probably be asking to see pictures of your wonderful day anyway so go ahead and show it off!"
4730,31333,"Well, since you and your fiance don't mind children coming, then you all ready have your answer.  But the idea of a babysitter being there during the ceremony and reception is a good idea.  Maybe have them stay with the babysitter during the ceremony and have them with their parents during the reception unless they become fussy or bored, they can always go back to the babysitter.  It's your and your future husband's call.  Whatever you decide, no one should interfere with.  It's your day after all!"

The prices were about the same there as anything we found here.  We ended up hiring someone here who will travel for us.  The travel fee was less than I expected, and so far things have been great!  Since she's here, we were able to have an engagement shoot and get to know her a little bit.  I think we'll be much more comfortable having her around on the big day because of it.

5593,39625,"Their very rich colors for a wedding in June. As I've suggested before to another bride you may want to head to a florist, and just pick out flowers in the colors you like, and go with that. This way you know what flowers are available. :) You can also head the the wedding section in bookstores and look at flower arrangements, those help so much in making decisions. Stick to colors you love, but remember Summer colors can be more vibrant!"
5599,39625,"I would like to be completely honest with you. DON'T DO IT. Have you ever seen the Bridezilla episodes where they think they can save money by making their own arrangements, and in the end they hate them, even though the night before they were convinced it was amazing! Remember that Flowers wilt, so unless you're having a bouquet of baby's breath, do me and yourself the favor, make a budget and head to your nearest florist. They looooove budgets, this way they know what to work with. Plus if there's a flower you absolutely love, and need to have they will work it into your budget, either by making smaller bouquets for bridesmaids and such. Besides you need to put your feet up, relax, and have a margarita the day before!"
5606,7873,"It isn't nesessary because they will be working for you during the Weding, so in essence,they are already invited, to work!"
5606,43873,"In general, it's not necessary. I have read that some photographers request an invitation as a means of verifying the date, time, and location. Many times things are changed after they are booked and the couple doesn't let them know. It's probably just easier to verify things in the weeks before the wedding, but don't forget to let everyone know if any details change."
5544,46106,"I ordered mine on <a href=""http://www.theamericanwedding.com"">theamericanwedding.com</a> and I LOVE them!  They have a whole range of prices, but the ones we liked best just happened to be pretty cheap.  I think I paid like $80 for 25 (w/ inner and outer envelopes), but it's only $1-ish more for each additional 25 after that up until 100."
5544,47165,"I ordered 100 (more than enough for me) from budgetweddinginvitations.com. It was a total of about $65 for the invitations, envelopes, and reply cards. I ordered the plainest ones I could get, but they're lovely. They're offwhite with nice raised black ink.

To be honest, I was worried about how they'd turn out...but I love them. They're very well done. They are plain, but I'm going to be remedying that by adding some stamping and ribbon. It'll probably cost me $20ish to spruce them up, plus a couple of hours of work with the Maid of Honor.

Sorry to ramble, but I just got them today, and I'm thrilled with how great they turned out, especially with the price."
5599,26876,"Do you have a green thumb? If you feel comfortable growing them, and feel you know what your doing, you may give it a try. I see your wedding isant till 2009, try it this year see how it works, grow what ever flowers you like and want in your wedding(atleast the ones in season). Play with arrangements. If it turns out to your expectations, go for it. If not you still have time to hit your florist up. You have time so try it out this year and see how it turns out, it may be a fun little experiment and experience which is part of the whole wedding planning experience. If you decide to try it out, keep me posted, i'd like to know how it turned out."
4760,48614,"Hi Jodie,

Congratulations to you and your fiancee on your upcoming marriage.  I was going to say ""We are Family"" is a good song, I notice a few people already mentioned that.  Celebration is also a great song - I like the idea of the Golden Girl's theme (Thank You For Being a Friend), and I also think the song ""That's what friends are for"" is an excellent choice.  If you want a slower song - maybe ""Through the Years"" would work for you.  Good Luck - I'm sure no matter what song you choose - your wedding will be a fantastic day to remember.  "
5606,20989,"As a photographer, I do not expect an invitation, especially since there is information that I need to know that you would not put on an invite, and most times the photographer is there much earlier than the start time, or is already with the bride taking photos of her getting ready.

One thing that I find monumentally helpful, though, is a program or bulletin.  Not only do I use it during the wedding itself, but also when I am sorting the photos afterwards.  It may be very helpful to your ""workers"" to have the day's layout in written form."
5588,49399,"It is your special day.  You should absolutely wear the color and gown that you want to wear.  You will look back at your portraits and be happy with your choice."
5088,49399,"You may also want to consider a morning or mid-morning wedding followed by a reception afterwards.  Luncheons tend to be less expensive than dinners.  Also compare buffet versus plated meals.  You may also choose to either minimize the selection of appetizers you serve or choose cold appetizers such as cheese (not gourmet) and crackers and some fruit.  "
5589,49399,"You can find some inexpensive favors at the Dollar store and tie them in tulle with hard candy (no chocolate) using a ribbon of your choice.  You can use give the table cards double duty and let that be the favor each guest takes home.  If you want to provide extra special gifts for certain family members, you may want to present the family member with centerpiece from the table.  "
5133,49399,"You are paying for the wedding, so your invitation wording would reflect that you are your fiance are extending the invitation.  You should review your photograph preferences with your photographer.  You will also provide the DJ or Emcee with your list for the presentation of the wedding party.  There is no additional explanation needed.  "
5494,14140,"I agree, invite everyone that will be invited to both the wedding and reception :)"
5546,31333,"One thing you can do is do a nice sit-down reception dinner for everyone with non-alcoholic drinks or music.  You can do the traditional toasts and everything.  In the invitations, you can inform all interested parties that there will be a sort of ""after-party"" where you can have all of the alcohol, dancing and music that you want.  The party can be optional and for everyone that wants to cut a rug.  This way a good time is had by all!"

5291,49145,"Do you also have pictures of the beaded stand?"
5415,31333,"I agree with the previous poster.  If his family are pressuring you both to include her (even though they're not close), then ""give in"" by giving her another assigned post.  Some say it's a good idea to have the groom's sister(s) as a bridesmaid, but ultimately the decision is up to you.  It is your day, and your closest friends/family should be the ones up there with you, sharing your joy.  I am including both of my fiance's stepsisters but only because I have gotten to know and love them, especially his youngest stepsister.  I don't have sisters, so I feel like they've all ready accepted me as theirs.  Do what makes you happy, hon.  This way you can really enjoy your day."
5306,31333,"My best friend/MOH lives 250 miles away from me and sometimes doesn't have money herself.  She is my best friend however.  We're practically sisters.  I understand the fact that she won't be able to be here for everything until the wedding comes a bit closer.  If you love your friend, you have to trust her enough that maybe these aren't just ""excuses"" but that her life is taking a bit of a presidence(sp?) right now.  It's probably not that she doesn't want to do all of that stuff for you, it's just that she can't.  But try giving her other stuff to do.  Like if you have to make some phone calls to vendors to confirm details or something, let her handle that.  Try to give her as much as you can so that she can feel involved and worthy of the title ""maid of honor."""
5545,26153,"if you dont nec. want both yellow and purple, purple and sage look good together, even if u do want to throw some yellow accents in, otherwise purple and yellow look good, but i would def. mix some other colors, maybe white/ivory...or even orange. :) "
5593,26153,"i am doing chocolate, and i was actually thinking of doing chocolate and a lavendar, they look nice together, otherwise chocolate and sage look nice together as well. I am doing ""neopolitan colors"", a chocoate, with blush, and ivory, with some gold accents. Chocolate goes with a lot of diff. colors! :) Good Luck!"
5464,26153,"My fiance and I have talked about this, and June is quite a ways away!!! I've read in a few bridal mags, and what i think is a good idea is to maybe not have sex for a month, or a few months before the wedding. If you are concerned about getting pregnant perhaps you should use both the pill and a condom, that is about...?? 198%..:) Sex is more than just that, it helps to connect the two of you, and if you were having it before, you do not want to lose that connection, i would say do not wait until June, ya'll will go nuts! :) And, you are engaged, don't you already have good communication/deep intimacy? (Unless this was a quick engagement) I do not think you man will cheat if he loves you, but June '09 is a long time to wait if you were already having sex. "
5464,49432,"I do not think that is a problem, i have been with my boyfriend for years now and we still did not have sex. we are waiting untill we are married which is (august 29,2009)for better and good reasons. what you and your future husband are trying to do is very smart. and you two can even learn new things about each other without even having sex. and the night of your wedding maybe very special because of the decisions you both made."

5648,39625,"Well firstly, what style is it? Seated dinner? food stations? buffet? cocktail party? Just knowing that will help alot. You've picked beautiful colors for summer also, as I've suggested to some of the other brides on here, head to a florist and check out flowers you like and want to use, that will help in a lot of ways. For instance if you chose orchids, you can do a whole theme around them. They come in tons of colors, you could use potted orchids as centerpieces, orchid print on invitations. To be honest flowers will inspire the rest of you. Ideas will just come rushing. So head to a florist! Good Luck!"
5645,31333,"Maybe in addition to the traditional ceremony, you can have a hand-fasting.  You'll probably have to find an officiant that would allow the mixing of the two.  Some might not.  I really don't know of anything else, though.  Maybe you can try looking up Wiccan wedding customs in books or the internet?"
5454,38720,"I wouldn't put them in with the invitations, but my bridesmaids are using them with the shower invitations...it's a start to getting the word out..."
5647,39625,"Well I'm not sure how much the Puck Building is, I have only been to a few events there, but I think they do allow self-catering. http://www.thepuckbuilding.com/index-1.html
I realize you are trying to save money, but I hope you know that it's better to do a late ceremony and reception, and just serve cold and hot hors d'oeuvre and cocktails then to give yourself the stress and headache of having to self-cater your reception. Try to cut cost in other ares of your budget. Now a days, it's considered chic to have a cocktail reception if a dinner isn't in the budget. So relax, hire an awesome dj or band, get great hors d'oeuvre, and people will talk about how memorable it was.
Good Luck :)"
5606,1779,"As a photographer, we received several invitations from couples... but only because the couples requested that we take a photo of the invitation on the wedding day!  Otherwise, an invitation is not expected for photographers. :)"
5605,1779,"We've shot two destination weddings, and both couples decided to hire us locally to travel to their weddings.  They found it much easier to contact us upon their return from the wedding/honeymoon... and shipping albums and prints was much cheaper too."
5654,39625,"Hi Mara,
for your attendants, if you aren't picky you can always tell them your colors are lilac and peridot, and that they can choose whichever color suits them best from those two and they can wear the same style dress if you would like (just in the color that's flattering to them). Your fiancee can always wear black, since champagne and black or silver and black compliment one another very well. 
By the way I love your colors, they sound gorgeous put together. I can't wait to see photos on here.
Best of Luck!"
5653,39625,"Wow, I thought I had posted on here. You may want to check out Martha Stewart's new bridal magazine since she just threw a tiffany themed wedding. You also might want to check out her website, and take a look at the wedding section, since she has a list of where she got everything for the Tiffany themed wedding.  I'm also not sure your going to find dresses in the exact shade of tiffany blue, but Coco Myles has a jewel blue and turquoise that looks sort of close - you may want to order swatches from them (that's free) and see what you think. Good Luck!"
5500,49541,"HEY! I live in Stafford now. There are a few nice places. For your hair, i used to work in a shop call Utopia. They are really good in there. Now, dont get me wrong, they do have mostly African American stylists, but they can do all types of hair. I would take a picture of an idea and then go ffrom there. I remember when I was working there, we did a whole bridal party's hair and they were all Hispanic with hair way past their shoulders...IT WAS CRAZY!!, but we got it done. The number is (540)720-8065, I would suggest getting a trial style before the wedding so there arent any upsets (but I doubt there will be) Now they dont do nails there, but I go to Cali nails which isnt too far from the hair salon.

( we even predicted the ""as a favor to me"" line"") it won't be pleasant, me & dd are the only ones we know of who have ever turned mil down for anything. i predict she may cry, and try to bring others in, but i'll stand firm."
5052,49652,"i'm future mil, and have one. don't have a fight, but make your decisions for good reasons, so you feel good about sticking to them. think, ahead of time, what parts have wiggle room, and what don't. i have learned, over 30 yrs of my mil, that she is spoiled, selfish and immature, but i'm not. she has said many silly, stupid, mean, or ridiculous things, and some nice, kind, helpful ones too. do not call her. think - if some one else, a co worker or friend, did the same thing, how would you react? her threat to have no one attend shows that she is unkind and selfish, and willing to hurt others, including her own kids. when you see her, ask her for an apology, and TAKE HER AT HER WORD! if she says she's not coming, say ok. if she says no one is coming, say ok.(Also fire people like drama,thats why they are good at their job, it's exciting, but putting up with it all the time, work & family, is too much.)"
5383,49652,"hey, i'm a lot older than you, and my mil still doesn't like me. of course, i've come to realize why, and since so many of the reasons are silly or pathetic, i just treat her with the respect i would any other human, and realize that you can't really expect much from some one like her.(some reasons: i'll take a class, try new places and things, [won't wait on her son hand and foot, but he still likes me],do volunteer work, like my own mom best, expect to visit my family once in a while, expect to go out to dinner or on vacation without mil, in other words, i don't treat her as queen. she hates that!) she actually said to me once, years ago ""I can't believe I let you take that baby on vacation"". the look on my face must have said it all, because she started stuttering and apoligizing, saying she didn't mean it, etc. she lives in a small, sad world of fear."

5053,39180,"I agree that you should have your close friends and family part of your bridal party. So to the individual who said that large bridal parties are tacky,I beg to differ. We had 15 on either side, 36 including ushers.  We invited 250 guests, 198 showed up. My photos are WONDERFUL and everyone talked about how much FUN they had at our wedding. Our bridal party was positioned so that everyone could see my groom and I with no problems. We had just the maid and matron of honors and the two best men sit with us at the reception, and let the rest of our party sit with their guest. Its all about planning and being organized.  I liked the ""if you haven't talked to them in x amount of days"" suggestion. That was great! We paid for our own wedding, and we used the now common practice of ""If you aren't married or living together or in a relationship for at least 6 months, you can't bring a date."" I am not feeding the usher Scotts floozy he randomly chose from his black book at 50.00 a pop. "
4813,39180,"Christina I totally disagree with you- MOH should be there to help the bride- no if ands or buts about it.  Catherine, I have seen this too many times at weddings I shoot...and its no fun for all parties involved. Call her up if you can't meet with her in person, and lay it all out. Tell her you understand if she is very busy with her life and has no interest with your wedding, but you really need some one for support. You would love to have her a part of your wonderful day, but if her life is too much right now, you understand and would be happy to have her as a bridesmaid or even just a guest if it would be easier on her. 

If that doesn't work, smack her around a little. (JUST KIDDING!!!)"
4760,39180,"Things I have seen while shooting weddings (a few had my jaw dropping):

Chicken Dance (this rocked, as the party had NO idea)
Electric Slide
Cha Cha Slide
I'll Be there for you (friends Theme)

while these are good songs for later, it sure is funny and fun to watch.

Personally, at my own wedding 8 years ago, all of my friends and family were really into swing dancing. We did the Sing Sing Sing (with a Swing) song and went out there and danced up a storm. We traded dance partners and just had a blast. The video is awesome!!

5383,49652,"don't worry about it, i've been married 25+ yrs, mr il's still don't like me. i'm polite and respectful, because that's who I am. their expectations are pathetic, my mil wanted a doormat who treated her like a QUEEN, and she didn't get it. does your fmil have any friends? i noticed my mil doesn't, never did. the only people who spend time with her are those who absolutly have to. her husband,(he hides in garage) sons, sonil, dil's and older grandchildren avoid her. her one daughter, and that ones dd, are the only ones who spend any more than minimum time with her. mil worked 37 yrs, same co., came out with NO FRIENDS. can you see who has the problem here ?"
5679,26876,"You do what you think is best, afterall it is your decision. She can always be a bridesmaid, which is just as important as the MOH. When I first got enganged I decided not to have a MOH because both of my sisters wanted to be it and also my bestfriend. I thought the whole thing was ridiculous so originally I had only bridesmaid. It wasn't till like 4 months prior that I decided to make my older sister my maid of honor, but they weren't mad, they were maybe a little relieved that they didn't have to have such a big responsibility. I always think your MOH should be the one you feel closest to, if you can't decide then you don't have to have one, its not a requirement afterall."
5679,45261,"If you were still close to your best friend then I'd say best friend for MOH. Your sister is family and will always love you and be there for you. I just had to make that decision and went with my best friend because I knew she would have more time to dedicate to me and the wedding and my needs and she would really take the job seriously ya know? Not that my sister wouldn't, but family tends to do more what they want than what you want sometimes.
Good luck!

5194,45261,"I am also doing three colors. We are lovers of the caribbean so our colors are sand, sea, and the sky. The bridesmaids (3) are each wearing a different shade of blue and green (aqua, pool, teal, honeydew - their choice) and I'm wearing sand. The groom and his guys are doing dark blue suits with a pocket square to match the colors of the ocean to represent the girls dress colors. Its going to be beautiful and flow just fine, which yours will too. Just be sure to include the color theme at the reception to really bring it home."

Just politely tell her, that's it's your day and they were not invited as a guest because you do not feel they need or want to share in your happiness. Also, unless her invitation said she could bring a date, she can't, nor can she pay for the person she wants to bring. Trust me, at least one guest is going to cause trouble, I ended up uninviting by fiance's best man and his past-bridezilla of a wife whose had the most ridiculous requests.  Always remember...it's your wedding."

Good Luck!"
5684,20989,"The purpose of save the date cards is to give the people you want at your wedding plenty of advanced notice so they can clear their schedule for your wedding.  Because of that, you want to be just as clear with your save the dates as you will be with your invitations as to who you are inviting.

However, regardless of the level of formailty you are choosing for your invitations, your save the dates can be a step or two less formal - so your envelopes don't have to be done by a calligrapher, for example, or you can hypenate street names (st. instead of street).

Hope this helps!"
5686,20989,"1 thing to keep in mind is most wedding photographers work primarily in the summer-there are few weddings in the winter. So if weddings are all a photographer does, that means the money they make in the summer has to last the rest of the year.
As for time estimates, when I do a wedding I attend-and shoot at- the rehearsal, then I am with the bride as soon as she starts getting ready for the day, which can be 5 or 6 hours before the ceremony starts, & I am there through the reception until the last guest leaves.
After the wedding I spend 4-6 weeks going through each photo-editing, cleaning & toning, & organizing them so each moment can be found quickly & easily. Since the amount of photographs easily reaches the thousands, this is no small task.
If cost is your primary concern, you can probably find a student or an amatuer. But since this isn't their means of living, they won't be as dedicated and you might not get the photos you are hoping for.
Hope this helps explain it a little!"
5531,31333,"I thought about that, too.  I want to have my wedding on the fourth of July 2009 and was concerned that family and friends would miss out on fourth of July activities.  But you can make it feel like a celebration of your wedding and that holiday anyway.  For mine, I'm having a formal ceremony and semiformal reception, and then afterward, inviting everyone to a fourth of July party at a relative's house.  There will be fireworks, and good picnic food and things like that.  In the end, it will feel like a family reunion, too, since that's when my grandmother likes to host hers."
5686,26876,"Its business, anything having to do with weddings will almost always cost more. But, pictures are all that you are going to have left after your wedding and 50 years from now, so I think its worth the money, and actually $1500 is not bad. Remember you will get pictures from it, your not just paying for someone to take the pictures and then still have to pay more to get pictures. Are you looking at photojounalistic photographers? They usually cost more than someone just telling you to pose like this and say ""cheese"" And if thats what you want (say ""cheese"" pictures) then have a family member take your pictures anyone can do that."
5687,26876,"Its not rude, but you need to make sure that your allowed to bring in another ordained minster to perform the ceremony. Also, is your pastor licensed? Im asking because when brining in someone else to a church, most places will require that they MUST be licensed or they will not let you do that. So figure that out first and then decide what to do. And, you have plenty of time."
5307,31333,"Maybe before you leave for your destination, do a couple of run throughs with a local make up artist and take pictures.  This will give you an idea of what to expect.  Then, if you decide to book the make up deal at your destination wedding, you can take those pictures with you and show that make up artist what look you want to achieve.  If you're not pleased with any of it, but you feel secure enough to do your own make up, then go for it.  Try finding tips online on how to do your own make up that looks good through a lens."
5686,4874,"Photography isn't an area you want to leave to chance. At the end of the day, when the food is consumed, the dancing is over, and the dress is packed away, it's the photography that will endure. Sure, you can ask ""Uncle Bob"" to photograph your wedding or even hire a $500 amateur shooter, but the truth is, you get what you pay for.
  
Photography is an expensive business if you do it correctly. It's not just a matter of purchasing a camera and a lens but rather multiple cameras, lenses, lighting, backup equipment, insurance, studio rent/mortgage, income tax, education, etc, etc, etc. Photographers spend hundreds of hours per year educating themselves in photographic and album design technique to provide the best possible service to their customers. To net $30,000 per year as a photographer, one must book around 100K to offset expenses. So, to borrow a phrase from another fellow wedding shooter, it isn't expensive because it's good, but rather it's good because it's expensive."
5605,43519,"I would definitely look for a photographer outside of a resorts recommendations. You don't have to just look locally to you either since you're already paying for the travel to your wedding, you could hire a photographer from anywhere in the country.  Best wishes!"
5673,21232,"I think it looks very nice. It doesn't looke like a ""club"" that first came to mind. It looks cozy and would allow people tp mingle.  The only thing that I see is where would you sit so that everyone can see you?"
5679,21232,"For me, I have two maid of honors and four bridesmaids. One of my MOH had a fit because she felt she should be the only one and just as important. Very selfish I think. But I told her that I was ""honoring"" both of them for the roles they played in my life. Yes, I knew her since we were kids and much longer, but she's not locally here (she's in Californian, I'm in Texas) and been here for me like my other MOH. We argued about if for a week. She said she'll just a greeter than or just a bridesmaid. I told her she was NOT going to ruin my day, nor was she going to make me ""choose"" who was more important in my life. She got over it since I stuck to my guns.  It's really awful to have to be in this type of position. Especially with others trying to MAKE you do something that your really don't want to. Just remember, it's your day, YOU'RE paying for the day, and they need to respect your decisions."
5682,21232,"I agree. It's your day! It's not about person X, but who you feel closest to and who you want and feel would enjoy your day with you. And if they are truly friends, they would respect your decision.  "
5677,49399,"Haitianbeauty,

I do not understand why a certain number  of choices is necessary to make a choice.  If you know what you want for your reception hall or theme, that should help you decide what hall works for you.  It would also help to know many guests, the type of cuisine, and form of service (sit down or buffet) you would like.  Cost should also be a factor.  These are items that would factor into finding the right place for you to host your reception or you could gather a list of 50 places.  

I find that too many choices focused on a number rather than one what fits what key items will make you happy only confuse the issue.  So focus on what you want, not on a number.

Good luck!"

5679,26153,"If you only have one sister, i would definitely go with having your sister as your maid of honor. (if you only want one, it's your wedding, if u want 2, that's up to you). If she is not your only sister, then to be fair I wouldnt have one over the other. If your bf and u are not as close as you were, that is another reason not to have her, family will always be family, but friends may go away. I had this same dilema when choosing, im super close with my bf, and have 2 sisters, i was not my sisters, so i did go with my bf. But...my bf only has one sister, so i expect her to have her. It is completely up to you!!! Whoever u think will be there for you the most is who you should have!!! :) It's a BIG job!!"
5682,43575,"Its your day! You decided what flies and not flies and if you didnt put guest or person's x name on the list then they are not invited. I would just tell her I am sorry but the wedding site is booked and I can not fit anymore guests into the wedding."
5357,43575,"I love it. Its so different and personal. I do agree maybe include a frame if your budget can handle it."
5679,35439,"I'm kind of in the same situation. I stopped talking to my best friend for months. We're talking again and when I talk about my sister being my maid of honor (since my best friend and I weren't talking while I was doing most of my planning), she seems disappointed that I don't cancel out on my sister. Problem with my wedding is, is that we're only having one person stand up for each of us. If you feel closer to your sister, that is who should be your maid of honor. My fiance said that your sister will always be your family, friends come and go. You don't want to regret it in the future. I had a girl be my bridesmaid in my previous wedding and I don't talk to her at all and I regret having her in my pictures that I'm saving for my son. Do what you feel is best and you won't feel any regrets later on. Good luck, I hope what I had to say helped."
4518,35439,"Yes, absolutely. I would be a little hurt that my fiance felt that strongly that I had cheated on him, but if it made him feel better, of course and he would do the same for me with no hard feelings. Why not clear their mind of that horrible thought? Maybe after the test, they would feel like they really could trust you and take your word from then on out."
5544,31333,"One thing you can do is make them yourself.  Like type out the wording that you want and maybe pick out some graphics you might like.  If you have a printing company in town, they can do a very nice job with stuff like that.  My mom got my brother's high school graduation invitations done at a local store here with his picture and they came out very nice.  My aunt made her own programs and they look better than if she would have bought them from a professional invitation company.  This is what I'm planning on doing.  Go to your local printing company.  They may have some samples of past work or can show you an idea of what they can do.  In the end, you'll spend considerably less but still have that professional look."
5697,31333,"No, it won't look bad at all!  A lot of brides opt for that look for its simplicity (and their budget as well).  It can still look as elegant as a whole bouquet of flowers.

Since your wedding is in October, and to help reduce the price of flowers, you should pick something in season.  Marigolds and dahlias come in a variety of colors, including reds.  Zinia are also in season during the fall.  To get a better visual of what they look like, either visit a local florist or go to Yahoo! images and type in the name of the flower.  Tying those flowers with a brown/espresso ribbon of any material will add the right touch to the look.  You can always opt for red roses!"
4756,31333,"For the themes of your tables, I love that idea!  That is very clever and original.  For the Vegas table, maybe find a black and white picture of ""Old Vegas"" and put it in a black frame with a white mat.  You can probably go online and find a print like that.  For the Paris table, maybe try to find a small Eiffel Tower (if you don't all ready have one) with a wedge of cheese and some crackers (edible centerpiece!).  As for the guest favors, luggage tags aren't a bad idea, but maybe find some inexpensive bags to go with them (like for toiletries or make up), depending on your budget and guest list size.  That idea would be especially good for your bridesmaids and groomsmen.  "

If you don't have naturally wavy hair, use rollers or a crimping iron to get the look. Add some beautiful flowers such as daisies to your hair along with a few ribbons. Why not choose a 1960's themed wedding dress to complete your look? The material should be all natural and simple, keeping with the hippie fashion theme. You may be able to find the perfect dress at a vintage clothing or second hand clothing store. If weather permits, go barefoot or wear a pair of sandals. Have beaded table accessories such as beaded napkin rings, brightly colored place mats with funky patterns, and even incense. You can also add special touches such as wedding favors in the shape of little trees or butterflies. wedding cake decorated with a peace sign prominently displayed in the middle?

5480,22715,"i agree with the last poster. Research. If allowed bring the candles, also a isle runner, you can get this at a craft store for about $25. I think a back yard wedding would be just great as well, or even consider renting out a VFW post or elks club. These are usually about $100 -$150 for up to 4 hrs. Have a JOP come to you ( they do this all the time) decorate as you see fit. Bring your own food buffet style and have a small cheep very nice celebration!You can hang white x mas lights for a added shimmer, candles on all the tables etc.. You get married right there in the hall.
Best of Luck!"
5686,43873,"It's not just the time that is spent at the wedding. It takes a lot of time to process the photos on the computer, editing, adjusting, tweaking, sorting, etc. to make the photos and the people in them look their best. As someone else mentioned, there is also a lot of education that goes into doing what we do. If those prices include an album, prints, disc, or other items, that is more time and materials.

You may find photographers who ""shoot and burn"" who are less expensive and will hand you a disc at the end of your wedding, but you may not be happy with the results.

Think of it in the same way as any other service- some people charge more because they feel their time, talent, and most importantly their product are better than others. 

You list you wedding date as June 5th, a weekday, you may ask if any photographers offer a discount for weekday weddings when competition isn't as high. Some will, many won't.

5695,43873,"If you are making a video from still photos, check out Adobe Photoshop Elements. I believe it's less than $100 and has a function that allows you to make a video from photos with pan and zoom effects. You can take that and add titles and music in Windows Movie Maker (included with Windows XP and Vista). I use these programs all the time, as well as Adobe Premiere Elements for video editing. You may also want to ask your photographer or dj if they can provide this service for you.

5697,39625,"Ok so if you want to keep cost down and go with a single flower, you can always go with Chrysanthemum ""Rebonet"", it's very pretty but full.  or You can do Spray Rose ""Tamango"" it's a cluster of lance-shaped petals and you'd only need a single stem which normally has about 4-5 flowers on the end. But if I may suggest, inexpensive bunches of flowers :) Baby's breath is absolutely gorgeous in bunches, it gives a beautiful simple glow, and is very full. or bunches of Dahlia. Or another inexpensive bunch you can make that surprises alot of people in cost is an Orchid ""James Storie"" they are absolutely beautiful and look very delicate but are so robust and can withstand heat.

5708,39625,"Hi, if your fiance thinks the expense of it all may be too much for her then perhaps you shouldn't ask her. I'm sure she would be honored if you did ask her, but she probably will also feel cornered into it if she doesn't have the funds. It sucks, but you know you don't need to have a maid of honor - There's no book that declares it a rule. You could always invite your girlfriends out to meet you, and let them know their won't be a maid of honor, but you want them to be part of your wedding day and ask them to be bridesmaids. Make them stand next to you according to height lol so it's all fair tallest to shortest or vice versa! They would probably think its sweet that you didn't want to leave them out :)"
5710,49399,"Lighter or pastel colors seem to sing out, ""Summer.""  There are so many beautiful shades of blue from which to choose.  Look at the options in blue available and pick out what appeals to you.  

A good option is to consult with your bridesmaids and get their opinions.  It will make them feel their input counts and it helps to get the buy-in from the people who will ultimately wear the color and style you choose.  "
5194,20989,"I shot a wedding with those three colors and it was beautiful. They had a garden theme as well and had terra cotta pots with wildflowers all over the reception site as decorations, and their favors were tiny terra cotta pots with seeds in a yellow and green cello bags inside the pot. It all flowed very nicely and went perfectly with their theme. The only difference is that they had pastels - a light lime green and a pale sunshine yellow. Either way, those colors are perfect for spring or for the outdoors and they go great together.
have fun with it!"
5708,26876,"Well, maybe you should ask her, and tell her that your fiance may think it may be hard for her economically speaking. You can tell her that you'd like for her to be involved some way and that you thought of making her your maid of honor, but you completely understand if she cannot. Also, its thoughtful that you want to include your sister in law, but you shouldn't expect your fiance to include your brother as his best man in return. i think you should ask her and see how she feels about the whole thing. Its one thing for your fiance to think she might not, but its another to hear it coming from her...you know? And, no you don't HAVE to have one, so you can tell her there is no pressure involved. "

Im not saying silver dresses, though...unless you like that color for a dress. So in other words all your colors should tie in together somehow. Do your bridesmaid dress have a sash? If so you can have a shade of blue(if you like that color) and a silver sash. I hope this sort of helps, if not sorry."

Beleive me its nice and all, but in my opinion its just not suitable for a reception. the fact that everything is in place does not allow for your creativity to come into play very much. If your worried about costs, have you considered outside of the city? "

I'm the one that's Catholic and he's technically Baptist (but he's never been Saved or anything that really confirms that he is).  I've been confirmed in the Catholic Church, but I rarely attend Mass anymore.  My mother would like for us to be married in the Catholic Church, but I have heard of the non-Catholic having to be christened Catholic before the wedding can take place.
We've started considering though having two officiants do the ceremony.  Maybe have a Baptist minister for you and a Catholic priest for him.  The traditions of the two religions can be combined and shared to make both sides happy and help you stay true to your own beliefs."

The other girls I just went up and told them that I would be honored if they would be my bridesmaid.  We're asking my fiance's best friend if he would be the best man by inviting him over to our house for dinner.  Inviting all of them out to dinner like the previous poster said is a wonderful idea.  Or maybe have an old fashioned slumber party with all the girls that you want to ask and maybe give them all t-shirts that say ""Bridesmaid"" on them (depending on your budget).  "

I paid $30 for a box of 50, and that includes the invitation, RSVP card, and envelopes for both.  They are very simple, but I think they're quite nice looking.  Target carries many different styles, and the one that I bought includes handmade looking heavy paper with leaves in it, a vellum overlay, and a ribbon to tie them together at the top.  Look around!  Michaels and even Walmart also carry kits with which you can do your own if you're so inclined.  Good luck!"

What about like a cobalt blue? It's right around in the middle of the ""blues"" and would go well with silver."
9543,39625,"Hi Jen, firstly I'd like to say you have plenty of time! A full year :) Now both the dresses you chose are pretty, but do you genuinely love at least one of them? You don't want to get it and be standing there in tears saying you hate it. If you really want to order one because of the price, then have a back up plan - just in case it doesn't look fabulous on you. See if you can return the dress, and if not see if you can sell it on Ebay, or Craigslist, or maybe even post it on here!  
But if you genuinely love both, I'd have to say they are both beautiful, the first dress has some beading which always adds a nice touch, and is very traditional. While the second dress is a little modern, has a lace overlay, which is always timeless. I'd have to say the second one.
Best of Luck!"
9546,39625,"Well just remember that the point of a shower is to open the gifts and play games ect. But it's your choice, and I understand the distance (I live in Ohio and my family is all in Canada) ;)
Most stores you register to, have the option of having everything shipped to your home. Check that out on the places you registered because you can pre-select that option, so that guests don't have an option. You don't want to write that on the invitations so the other thing you can do, is let the organizer of the bridal shower spread it around ""word-of-mouth""!
It's also ok to include registry announcements, most places give little tickets to put into the invitations. 
Good Luck!"
9543,26876,"Its true that you do have a year, but its never too early to decide. I bought my dress two years prior for many reasons, one being price as well. But, what I would suggest is go to a bridal store try on some dresses that you like, maybe even similar to the ones you saw online, so that you atleast know how it might fit and decide from there. You can also find some of the dresses you tried at the store, and find them online. Remember to take note of the designer, and style #. Good luck."

5530,50366,"I am getting married in October, but I am also a wedding DJ and have seen MANY weddings.  Buffets don't seem to be tacky at the weddings that I have DJ'd for.  Things to consider are:  It takes more time to go through a buffet and sometimes the people going to the buffet last are trying to hurry up and finish their meal before the other festivities are starting.  If you do go with a buffet have the DJ announce (with the catering staff's blessing of course) that each table will be invited individually to the buffet by the catering staff.  This way you will not have a line a mile long.  Another option is to have your salads and bread are already served on the tables so that everyone has something to eat as they are waiting to be invited to the buffet, that seems to keep everyone happy.  Good luck with your decision."

""Strengthening your connection"" should be done before you even get engaged.  Sex is not just a bonus in a relationship, it's actually a very important part of it.
If you were doing it before you were engaged then there is no reason to completely stop.  At most, I could maybe see the week before your wedding to increase the excitement for the wedding night.
The theory that men who really love you don't cheat, only happens in the movies ladies.  Men are very sexual by nature and it's selfish for you to think that taking away something they've been getting already is going to help your relationship.  Guaranteed if you polled men about this, 95% would think this is a stupid idea...the other 5% are gay.

perhaps if you have a friend that is getting married before you, if you are confident; try helping your friend with her flowers, to get some experience with what you would need for your own wedding. (maybe this is a start to a business venture for you)

 I would really give it some thought. You should be relaxed and worry free on your wedding day...You should get plenty of sleep and feel radiant and carefree the next day...if doing your followers does not keep you up all night and if it does not keep you from really enjoying your day of pamper and premping. Then go for it...but you can't do everything( Get some help from family or friends)

9584,26876,"seems like you have a lot going on. I think you should discuss this with your photographer, they know best as far as how much time they may need it shouldn't be a lot though. As far as setting up, depending on your venues thats fine, just make sure they are allowed to do so first. Are there two photographers or just one? If two then they don't have to be together in the same place right? The formal pictures usually can take longest because you have people coming in and out of the picture, and that really depends on how cooperative they can be. So talk to your wedding party and tell them that picture time means serious business since you are on a time constraint. "
9586,26876,"Stress, I know about stress. I planned for two years, while working part/full-time and going to school full-time, and doing school projects was like a part-time job in its self. so I know how you feel, its very overwhelming. I suggest making a list of everything you need to get done, try to take things a couple at a time, first off your venue, right now thats priority more than your dress. As far as the dress is concerned, I suggest going to other bridal stores, try on as many as you want and need to. Go back to DB's if you have to try on the ones you like, I think the more you go, you will eventually know which on is for you. I just looked at the dresses, and I am assuming you want color right? I did too, I got my dress from Alfred Angelo, you can look at my pics. I would check them out as well, they have lots in color."
9584,20989,"The amount of time that it takes for your pictures depends mostly on what you want.  The more people involved - parents and family of the bride and groom, wedding party, etc. - the longer it takes.

Something simple that you can do to cut down the time significantly is make a list beforehand of EVERY picture that you want taken, and who that involves.  I have a checklist that the bride and groom fill out, you can email me if you would like a copy of my checklist.

Another thing that may speed things up is if you have someone who is well acquainted with everyone and knows everyone's name to act as an ""assistant"" to the photographer - this person's job would to be to go down the checklist with the photographer, and call out all the people who need to be in the photograph, and since this person knows who is who, they can speed these people along in getting into place.

Lastly, make sure everyone you want in pictures is 100% aware of this ahead of time.

Hope this helps!"

5686,49652,"thank you all. i know it sounds odd, but i DO want a photog who will shoot good pictures, and give me a disk. i don't need or want a photog at the rehersal, or while I'm dressing. i'm not a big ""take lots of pictures person"", i only want the smallest package, or number of pictures, i don't want to keep stopping and taking pictures. i don't want 50 pics at home, and one of every step thereafter. i've been to too many weddings where the photog really annoyed everyone, and while the wedding photos looked nice, the reception was horrible because the photog turned it into a photo shoot!! i'm sure no one who answers here does it, but the most important part of the day is NOT the pictures. and the weddings i'm speaking of spent ALOT of money to have the photog really make the reception unpleasant. that's why i can't use their photog.I want to design my own album, and mix wedding pics with my other albums, too. i find it boring to look at a huge wedding album, i like smaller MUCH better."

Second, at one point in time, I felt somewhat how you do: Why just stop all of a sudden????  However; this is something that she wanted to do initially and I wasn't at all for it.  But now, I'm completely behind it.  The factors that Tyffany mentioned as to why we are not having sex are very, very important to the both of us.  And protecting and supporting those factors are something that we hold dear to ourselves as a couple.  I do appreciate the responses and input from everyone, but know this: That whatever she wants and feels strongly about, I will ALWAYS be her #1 supporter, whether I understand or agree with them at first....Thank you for you time and good night."
5709,8287,"I agree with all posters and another thought is even if you asked everyone by phone or in person...A nice card to express your thanks and your relationship is great...it is amazing and touching for people to see in black and white the length of your relationship and how much they measn to you...it may fuse harmoniousness for the wedding planning.  NOTE:  Make sure in choosing that you have reliable people to stand up for you emotionally and financially.  I have had brides that ended up coming out of pocket at the last minute for bridesmaids or bridemaids who fell out at the last minute due to finances or jealousy.


"
5531,20989,"I've shot many weddings on holiday weekends, and it's always been a great time. The people that love you and want to be there for you won't mind spending their holiday celebrating your wedding. People tend to be excited and in holiday-mode, so that makes for an extra fun time, especially at the reception.

If I may be so bold as to make a suggestion, if you are going to go for a holiday wedding, I would have a semi-formal affair. People are going to really want to celebrate and not be inhibited. If you want a formal or more serious wedding and reception, it might be best to pick a non-holiday.

Hope this helps! Good luck with finalizing your date."

9598,50366,"I guess I am a little confused.  If you don't have a problem with an ""open marriage"" which by definition is you can have other sexual partners then you should be okay with the marriage arrangement that you have stated.  Are you upset that he did not tell you before he had the sexual activity, hence ""cheating"" by your definition?  You had asked how do you forgive him?  If he wants an open marriage and you are ""okay"" with that, you don't have to ""forgive"" anything, if it is an open marriage, because it will happen over and over again.  Also, you may want to rethink what your marriage vows, because the ""foresaking all others"" should not be in there.  Give it some thought...if you are this upset before you get married, then it will be magnified ten times over after you are married.  Good luck with whatever you decide.

9598,39625,"It's always unfortunate to hear that your significant other has not been faithful. An open relationship, is for people who are not ready to commit to one person, it's not about sexual appetite, especially if your partner is open to your ideas. 

As someone who was in an open relationship for a year, and dated many others while my ex dated his share...it started to become too much. We connected amazingly in the bedroom and intellectually. But after that year we decided to become exclusive and let everything out, so that there was no question about anything. Well I may have been dating other men, but I never went further than kissing, and when he started listing the women he got involved sexually with, I became jealous. And I knew I couldn't trust him, even though he was honest from the beginning. It was the fact that while we were together being intimate, he was being sexually active with 2 or 3 girls. We're good friends now, and realized it was an interesting experiment."

My ""stats"" were obviously an exaggeration to make a point, which was that WAY more men were not going to be behind the idea when asked.  That's great that you support her and you want this too...good luck with that.
I do, however, find it ironic that you get defensive to a response that doesn't agree with yours when the question asked for opinions in the first place. 

Anyway, sorry if you took offense by my response, I meant none by it.
"
9592,39625,"Well to make things a little easier you can always print out a list of his guests, and hand it to him and just tell him to fill in the addresses. That way it's on one piece of paper, and you can see if he's actually working on it. The other thing you can do is try and get the email addresses of guests you need, and send them an email asking for their address :)
Also, keep a little note book in your handbag, so when your out and bump into people you can write their address down. Just remember you have time to get the invitations out so don't stress about it. Good Luck!"

Good luck and congratulations :)"
5464,37778,"I did ask for opinions and did not get offensive, my fiamce is just very supportive and loyal and the thought that someone is saying he will cheat on me over something as silly as sex when there are deeper issues behind it bother him.  You have to understand that I said their are people who dont agree with this so you are not the first to say ""men cheat"" after hearing that about your self over and over when you know it not to be true can get frustrating and all hhe was doing was for the first time voicing HIS opinion on the matter"
9598,47284,"Is he Raelian?  :)  The point is not to tell you what kind of man he is or to define anything to you--that's not what you're asking for. You are in a position where you have to decide why he would be unfaithful, lie to you and then propose an open marriage.  Just remember a man that lied to you about cheating can lie to you little things too!  And those ""little"" things don't end up being so small, especially when you end up with an STD because he picked up some hooch from the bar when he was ""out with the boys.""  That's scary, girl!  And I wouldn't rely on his telling you he would always use protection and he promises he'd be safe and blah blah, bc the truth is, most guys don't use protection & most of them lie and say they do!  If you want to share you body and have other's bodies shared with you, with a serious risk, then consent to it.  But this is a reality of the situation & you have to find out if he is worth the infidelity, late nights, cover ups & trips to the health dept!"
5667,33116,"I agree.  I haven't ordered my invitations yet, but one I like a lot is from theamericanwedding.com and they sent me a free sample to see and it looks great.  My best friend also used them for her wedding last year and her invitations were awesome.  Not sure why people are having complaints..."
5464,50559,"I didn't say ""men cheat"". What I referred to was the theory that if a man loves you, he won't cheat no matter what. Which in many many cases is true, I just find it hard to put all of the blame on a man who was use to getting something, then got it taken away. I was generalizing, not saying fiance would.
Think of this tho: What if your man took you out to dinner every night, gave you foot and back rubs every night, and spent every waking minute tending to you, then once you say, yes I will marry you he completely ignores you saying this will make your relationship stronger and he wants to connect on another level..?
We obviously have a different opinion on the importance of sex in a relationship, which is fine as long as you and your partner are on the same page. I just giving a different perspective on the subject.
As far as other people's opinions, tell them what you say here. It may help to know you are together on it. If all else fails, the baby excuse should work :)
Best wishes."
9605,50559,"The first things you want to take care of are the ceremony and reception venues since they will sort of set the tone for the wedding. 
When I first got engaged (11 months before the wedding), we did the venues, caterer and dj right away...then I did a few little things here and there, choose colors, asked friends to be in the wedding, but actually didn't do much more for a few months! At about 6 months before, I finally found my dress and bridesmaid dresses and things really started happening.
The biggest help has been the wedding checklists that you can find anywhere; the one on here is really good. They help you keep your head on straight as to what should be done and when :)

If you are open minded about things with the wedding, you could plan one in no time; it's when you have certain things you won't compromise that take longer and need to be done more in advance. I bet you could make a wedding happen in 3 months if you really wanted to ;)

Good luck and congratulations!"
5307,20989,"It sounds like you know exactly what you want, if you're like me, when I know what I want it's better to do it myself. You said you've had bad luck in the past, and that's not something you want to risk on your wedding day!

I think Liz gave the best advice-just like everything in life, the trick to getting it right is a lot of help and practice beforehand.

A few photogs told you to go pro. As a professional photographer myself, I'd like to weigh in on the other side. You don't need your make-up done professionally to look beautiful in your photos, especially if you get pro advice beforehand. If you talk with your photog beforehand (which you should do anyway) and explain the look you want in your photos, they should be able to find flattering light and angles to give you what you want.

I agree with Paris that a pro gets paid for exactly that reason, but the difference is while I doubt you take photos every day, you probably do your own make-up daily.

Hope this helps!"

9584,34308,"Timelines are tough. As a planner, I have to work on a few drafts before we get it right for all involved.Most of the photographers I use will have an assistant when there are so many sites involved.The main photographer will be with the bride and the well qualified assistant will be with the groom during prep and pre-ceremony photos. This can be an 1-1.5 hours before you will leave for the church.Now after the ceremony, depending on how long your ceremony is.Most of the Catholic churches allow us 15 mins after the ceremony for pictures.Then travel to the photography site should be between 10-15 mins away.Wedding party and family they should get a copy of the timeline and be aware just how important it is to stay on time.You can get a lot of good shots in 45 mins to an hour.When I create the timeline for my clients I give out copies to the families and wedding partyat the rehearsal.

Surely dont let him wear stark white!  off-white at the most if he insists, tan at best!  cream.... but your colors are gorgeous!  and you can do soooooooo much with them!
these days nothing is match on match to say,  as far as the wedding party, it is the color combo, okay, out of the three, pink, mocha, green (dark or light?), if it is light, green, could you possibly mix a navy blue in with that?  ie, to incorporate your something blue?
ie, your handsome groom could do navy and maybe somewhere you could have some navy showing?
good luck, sounds gorgeous and i know you will find your true colors!
let me know if i can help!

laurie!

5697,32013,"I also would suggest a Calla Lily.  They come in a variety of colors.  Calla Lilies are beautiful flowers and they have such elegance.  I used calla lilies for my wedding as well and had them tied with a single ribbon.  If you would like to do something different for your maid and/or matron you can slightly change their bouquet and have them carry 3 Calla Lilies with a ribbon instead of one. Either way you can not go wrong with calla lilies.

9605,45992,"It's never too early to plan your wedding...some venues have a two year waite (glass chaple in Palas Verdes, Ca) I always give my brides a list of things that help them get organized.
1. Three Ring binder
2. Dividers/ Tabs
3. Calendar (1year) to write your apointments
4. Pockets or page protectors to put pamphlets or brouchers
5. Calculator
6. a Budget
7. Time line ( you can find them online to print out WeddingWire might have one)
8. Telephone number page That has all of your vendors and Bridal party's numbers and names so you can quickly access.

Attending Bridal shows are important it allows you to see the vendors up close without running all overtown and helps get you motivated too.

Happy Planning!

9598,26876,"Whoa! I have to commend you first on putting this out in the piblic. Secondly, Im sorry that you have been put into this situation. Now, for my opinion. I am having a hard time trying to swallow the fact that now all of a sudden he wants to have an open relationship/marriage and be able to sleep with anyone after the fact that he cheated on you. I think if that is what he really wanted, he should have talked to you first and then done it...it would have made more sense( a little anyway). Anyway, he's asking you now to be what I would call a ""swinger"". You have every right to be upset, he's violated your trust, and thats not something that can simply be replaced with an, ""its ok honey."" So I think that you know whats the right thing to do, I don't need to tell you what to do, you do exactly what your heart tells you. Should you commit to that type of relationship, I wish you the best of luck!"
9605,26876,"I agree with the prior responses, get your venues done right away. I would suggest The Grand Atrium, in Vienna, VA. They mainly do receptions, but depending on how many people are invited they can accomodate a small ceremony, like 30 seated comfortably. You only pay one bill there, food, venue, chairs tables, linens, DJ all in one place. So that saves you a lot of time and money. There are awsome and the food was great! The prices are very competative and can do buffet, or plated style dinner. The cost really depends on day, time, and how many people you invite, so you can have a lot of control in the price. Anyway, check them out, and you would have knocked out a lot on your checklist if you go with them. Good luck and happy planning."

9592,26876,"You have plenty of time...as mentioned before. So, take a deep breath and relax. Remember, most guys aren't into the planning of the wedding, thats why most girls say its their day, because the do most of the plannig. Anyway, if you aren't planning on seding out Save the Dates, then just wait about the time you order your invites, assuming he will be with you to pick them out, you can give him a friendly/serious reminder of the addresses and I am pretty sure he will realize that he no longer can procrastinate...or I would assume so.

It does bring a lot of changes and there has to be a lot of compromising, but it comes with the package! "

If you really want to relax on the sand and enjoy some snorkeling, go to Ambergris Caye (Pronounced Aber-geese Key).

It's your wedding and you want bold beautiful joyful colors. I'd like to make some suggestions.Of course you want bold flowers, so why not go with something very robust - Mini Calla Lilly ""Schwarzwalder"" it's a red chocolaty color. There's also the Rose ""Black Beauty"" it's unscented and has a dark velvety bud - it's a dramatic rose. There's also the Ranunculus which you can get it a very dark red, it has a high petal count, and is actually best in the fall. When you meet with your florist tell him/her you want something in the bouquet to pop, and see if he/her can make suggestions, they will also be able to let you know if it's available! Best thing to do is head to a florist and ask to see their cooler.
Good Luck :)"
5438,50366,"Some people may WANT to give you a gift, so go ahead and register, but I would not put it in the invitation.  That is something that should be word of mouth.

I find registries very helpful when I am buying a gift for another couple.

9592,45923,"I had the same problem with my fiance...except it was his family who was procrastinating...they were the ones who had the addresses and they wouldn't give them to him. Very frustrating...so, I know how you feel. 
Eventually, I took the guests names and got online and searched the white pages...I did this anyway with all of my guests just to try to make sure I had the correct spelling. When I finally did get his names/addresses I was so happy that I had gone to the white pages-all the names were spelled wrong and the street names were spelled wrong. So you can always go online and look at the white pages. There are going to be some were you obviously can't know for sure...like if someone's last name is Smith...but you may be able to get some.
You can also go to his family. His mother? Aunt? Maybe one of his sisters?
Look at each guest individually. Do you know anyone you could talk to that knows that guest. I know it's frustrating and best to get it from him; but do the best you can"
9598,49193,"Marriage is about committing to each other. If the two of you aren't enough to make each other happy, then you don't belong together. The fact that he did this just a few months before your wedding says that he's definitely not ready for marriage. The fact that you call him an idiot and an asshole says that you do not believe in this type of relationship. I find it hard to believe that if he told you he was going to go out and sleep with someone you would be okay with it. I think that you are contemplating forgiveness, acceptance of this lifestyle, and continuuing with the marriage because you don't want to cancel the wedding. Don't go through with it if there's any doubt that it will last. Cancel the wedding, lose your deposits, people will understand. Then get your head out of high school and find someone who will commit to you. 
Go sleep with someone and ask him how he feels about it the next morning when you kiss him as you walk through the door.

9616,46106,"I can't answer your question at all, but just wanted to say that if you like poppies, I wouldn't worry too much about the symbolism.  If the money/timing/integrity of the flowers stuff all works out, I say go for it.  I think they're gorgeous, and it's your wedding!  I seriously doubt people are going to be looking at you with your lovely dramatic bouquet thinking about sleep or death.  But that may just be me. =)"
9598,46106,"It seems a little odd to me that this is coming up now, and isn't something you discussed before you got engaged as you talked about your future together.  That being said, no one can answer this for you.  You just have to decide if this is what you really want.  This is a completely different agreement than the one you accepted when you got engaged. If it were me, I'd be thinking of it as an entirely new proposal.  Are these terms that you're willing to accept?  Can you feel fulfilled with this man under these conditions?  If you're at all uneasy about this new picture of your future together, you might consider at least postponing the wedding.  You don't want to walk down the aisle full of doubts and confusion.  It's also important that the two of you have time to come to an agreement and both have a clear understanding of each other's feelings and expectations.  It would suck to get married only to find out that the commitment he thought he was making differs from what you assumed."

9605,2723,"Congratulations on your engagement. You have alot on your plate right now with school and planning a wedding in 5 months. 

As a bridal consultant, I can tell you that it can be done. The most important thing you need to take care of quickly is your venue(s). Most popular venues book 1 year in advance. You may have to be flexible by booking on a Friday or Sunday. Saturdays will be difficult.

Your vendors will be the next step. It's very difficult to find quality vendors in only 5 months. Again, by booking on a Fridy or a Sunday, you might still be able to get a great photographer and dj. 

Start calling around to find out what venues are and vendors are available in your desired month. Again, be flexible with your date. Waiting one month can ensure your event is as wonderful as you always dreamed.

Consider the services of a good wedding coordinator in your area. They can save you alot of time and sanity, because they know the best providers in your area and budget.

5599,2723,"Lisa,

I would advise you not to grow your own flowers. Here are the reasons why. You have no guarantee that your investment will be worth the risk. What if they don't grow? What if you have a pest problem? What if they don't look as good as your were hoping?

Most florists won't want to work with product you provide. Their reputation is on the line if they die or look less that wonderful. 

The closer your wedding gets, the more responsibility you will be faced with. You don't need the added stress and possibility of having to find a floris at the last minute.

In my years of experience, I've always had clients that are looking for a way to save money. Every time it's ended badly. 

Consider this very carefully. Your bouquet will be featured in you portraits and your guests will be sitting at a table looking at the flowers for 4 or more hours. Many florists are creative with budgets and can offer alot of alternatives for you.

Good luck."
9577,49399,"Do the benches have backs to them?  Also, you will need to think about how people will be able to sit down and get up from the table when necessary.  Keep in mind, it is very hard to scoot into and out of a bench (not the mention the possible dirt to be rubbed onto clothing) with a dress or skirt on and still be proper."
5709,50833,"All my close friends found out about my engagement minutes after it happened, so they knew my asking around would come soon enough. 
What I did, was I went and bought really inexpensive, cubic-zircona, rings that almost resemble mine, and in the box, I wrote a note depending on the person. For example, for my matron-of-honor: ""Through all the craziness we've been through, the laughs and tears we've shared, and the secrets we've exposed, it is only right that I ask my best friend to be my maid-of-honor. Yes   No   Maybe?""
I then slipped it into their bags, and waited for their response.
Lets just say they all wear the rings on their right hand and naturally said yes."
5530,50833,"Hi Marta,

I actually had the same dilemma until I sat down and meticulously figured things out.
Just recently, a friend of my fiance had a buffet-style wedding which turned out very badly. He had about 150 people, and we were actually the last table to go (after being announced), and all that was left was corn, salad, and some pasta salad.
I am going to go buffet-style despite the incident, because I know to always plan for at least 20 more. Some people eat a lot, some less, so lets say you have 150 people, order for 170 at least."

5708,21742,"This was one of the toughest decisions for me because I have 3 very close friends and 3 sister's I'm close to and they are all equally important to me, so I didn't want to choose between them. I stressed over it for weeks. But then finally I just started talking to them individually about it and everything fell into place for me. The one I chose for my maid of honor, I was afraid would be overwhelmed, but she was ecstatic. I made it clear the only important thing for me was that she stand beside me on my wedding day. If you talk to your future sister-in-law and tell her exactly how you feel about it, I think you'll be surprised at how honest she will probably be about any hesitations. Honestly, I think she would be honored, but make sure she knows you don't expect her to plan everything (bridal shower, bachelorette party, etc.) and that your other friends would be happy to handle that. If she seems hesitant tell her to sleep on it and get back to you. I think it will all work out!"

9663,39625,"Well I don't know what your colors are. But a neat centerpiece that's not too costly is a pyramid of Ferro Rocher Chocolates. What you could always do is get a pyramid shaped Styrofoam, and hot glue the chocolates (in wrapper and all), and stick a cute sheet of paper or something on the table with ""Make the Moment Golden"" (their slogan).  One cool thing you can do, so that when the chocolates are removed - and there's a giant white spot, is spray paint the cones gold before gluing on the chocolates.
The gorgeous thing about it is you can pick different height pyramids, and just have little tea light candles around the table to add a glow. You decide how much you want to spend on chocolate since you decide height/width! Good Luck!"
9663,26876,"I bought large feathers, like ostrich feathers and bought tall vases which I found on ebay for really cheap and I put the feathers in the vase, I also added glow sticks in the vase to give it that special effect to it. I think I spent no more than $175 for about 14 tables. I think thats really really cheap. "
5307,18961,"I think it would be a great idea for you to do your own make-up! If you do it yourself you will be in complete control of what is too much or too little. I would suggest going to your favorite make-up line in the mall and ask them to do you make-up as if it were your wedding day. Many times this is free or you just have to make a $30 purchase, which is rather easy these days. Nordstrom has a great selection of quality make up. And do not be afraid to ask questions when they are putting on your make-up and watch them in the mirror on how they contour the brushes etc. The best make-up investment is good brushes. The cheapest make-up can look great with a good set of brushes. I have done several weddings and I plan on doing my own and I am not a professional I have just learned through people doing my make up. I would suggest MAC, Laura Mercier of Bobbi Brown. You will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!! Good Luck!"

I don't think that it's wrong not to have a maid of honor. It's the tradition, but if it's easier to not have one, maybe that is the best thing for you. 

I think that if you want your sister-in-law to be the maid of honor, you can ask her in a way that will not make her feel cornered. :) You can work out something that you are both comfortable with for your maid of honor. Maybe she cannot throw you a bridal shower because of the expense or because she does not live near you. If you're clear in your ""expecations"", I'm sure it would work out. 

I can't wait to see other opinions as well. 

"
9563,42429,"We started our toasts during dinner, so people wouldn't get too antsy and not listen to them.  We went Maid of Honor, Best Man, Father of the Bride, and then his father got up and spoke, which we didn't know he was going to do.  But I thought the dad's speach should be last because it was the most special.  
You can basically go in any order you would like.  I just suggest doing them all at once because once the party gets going, no one is going to want to stop to listen to people talk.  
Hope this helps.

9649,26876,"I had a summer wedding as well( in July), and my colors were Reds white and Black. And reallly any color you decide will be fine, whether it be black, or all white, the reason being, its your wedding Who cares! If your having an evening wedding, dark colors will be fine especially if you want to have a formal wedding. Light colors go good too, but I think even better for a earlier wedding. I would suggest deciding on what flowers you want, then you can research what colors they come in, that will give you an idea of what color options you have. But, believe me what ever colors you decide on, it really doesn't matter because its your wedding and you want it to be uniquely you and not to resemble anyone else's right? "

5256,20989,"These days it's becoming quite chic for the people in your bridal party to be similiar, but not the same. Like Decades already alluded to, it might be cute to try and give your maid of honor a little spalsh of color to tie it all in, but having her in a different dress makes your wedding party more visually interesting and completely avoids the possible peril of looking cookie-cutter-esque.

It might be a good idea to mention this to your wedding photographer (although I'm sure they'll notice!) so that way they can be thinking of ways to shoot your wedding party that breaks them up in interesting ways, rather than have them uniformly standing in symmetrical patterns.  That way your wedding photography will truly reflect your wedding party.

Hope this helps!"
5233,20989,"I don't have an answer for your bouquet (sorry!) but since you are having an outdoor beach wedding, I thought you might be interested in something I saw recently.  I shot an outdoor wedding this summer, and instead of a unity candle they used a vase of sand.  The mother of the bride and groom carried a small glass vase of different colored sand down to the front where a table was set up with a large vase with decorative rocks on the bottom.  In the ceremony, the bride and groom each took their vase of sand and poured it into the large vase.  It was the same concept of a unity candle, but much better for an outdoor wedding (wind wasn't a problem) it fits perfectly into a beach wedding, and it was visually stunning (there are pictures on my website - www.perezsisters.com if you want to check it out).

Just a thought!  Good luck with your bouquet-alternative planning!"
4734,20989,"You definitely should not do anything that makes you embarrased on your day! It is becoming more and more popular not to do the garter toss or to have a more tasteful alternative.

When I was in college I did study abroad in Finland, and they had a tradition I've seen a few times in the States.  The single women form a circle around the bride, who has been blindfolded. The bride turns slowly in one direction and the women, holding hands, turn in a circle in the opposite direction. The single women's circle stops and the bride reaches out and hands her bouquet to the woman facing her. Then they do the same with the groom, the garter and the single men, but the garter was not taken off in public.

Hope this helps!

Write all of the stuff that's on your mind but also write how worth it it will all be when it comes time.  A little meditation helps too.  For 10 minutes after you've gotten ready for bed, just sit in a comfortable spot and clear your mind and just focus on taking slow, deep breaths.
That's what helps me! lol

2187,20989,"hello, and congratulations on your wedding. I agree that there is no sense in putting your dress in a box and leaving it in the back of your closet.

instead of selling it, have you considered having a Trash The Dress session?"
1319,20989,"I have shot several Trash The Dress sessions, and what I've found it's perfect for brides who have a particular location where they would like thier portraits done, but are afraid of getting their dress dirty on their wedding day.  Also, it helps the brides I've worked with feel all the money they spent on their dress is justifies, because they get to wear it for more than one day.  It's a whole lot of fun, you get some amazing photographs, and in most cases, the dress is fine after dry cleaning.

I haven't had the time to put up a lot of my work lately, but here's a link to my favorite shot from my last Trash the Dress session:

You can also go see a hairdresser, have a trial done, tell them your dress style, I am pretty sure they have encountered many situations and will know best what would look better for you.

9626,51298,"Trust me on this!  Coming from an Owner of a gown shop (Not David's Bridal)  dresses that are ordered online always have something wrong with them.  I am constantly seeing brides that have ordered their gowns online coming into my store for help.  They come in the wrong size, even though the tag may say the right size, they often switch size tags, the dress is cut incorrectly and fits funny, or isn't the dress that was ordered in the first place.  Many of the brides have had to put anywhere from $100 to $500 in alterations to get their gown fixed to fit them correctly or to the right size.  Shop around and see what's out there, if anything find a legit store and order it from them and have it sent to you if not in your area.  At least they hold the responsibility to provide you with the correct gown, instead of you ending up with a nightmare!        "

9626,17394,"I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with the first post. Although getting a dress from a store is ideal, because you can go in for fittings and see it in person, I bought my dress for my own wedding online. I contacted a company all the way in China.

My fiance felt that my dad should walk me down the aisle. My mom said if he did that would be like a slap in the face to her. Really, the last thing I needed from my mom on my wedding day. I wont lie to you, in the end it wasn't all perfect. My dad did walk me down the aisle, my step-mother (who divrced my dad about 5 years ago) was there, and my mom didn't come to the ceremony. My mom came to AZ from CO, stayed in a hotel and didn't show up to my reception till 1030pm, about an hour before my new husband and I were ready to leave the party. I'm glad she finally showed up and got to see me in my dress. It really was too bad that she missed everything else. However, I had a lot of support from other family members and friends.

I personally made my best friend my matron of honor, but she and I are really close, and have been friends since the 6th grade. If you are closer with your sister, simply make her the maid of honor, but give your best friend some things to do to show her that she is needed too. She should understand how close you are with your sister."

Blue dresses were worn in mideival times and you can definantly still be the perfect bride in a blue dress. I am a wedding planner as well as a former bride myself not too long ago. Although my own dress was Ivory, I think one of the best dresses I have seen on a bride to date was a beautiful red wedding gown. Unconventional, yes, but soo dramatic. There are a lot of maternity dresses out there, and I am sure you will find something for your maid of honor. "

So, I fed her that morning like usual and the rest of the day and evening she took a bottle of pre-pumed milk or sippy cup of juice or water.

9757,49399,"Perhaps you could try a decorative (small) treasure chest.  Some craft stores sell them and you can decorate them yourself.  You would take some material and glue it around the top (while the chest is open) cut a whole in it wide enough for envelopes.  To accent the material, wrap tulle around it or a wide ribbon.  You may even be able to find a suitable chest in a store you can decorate."
9725,28508,"I think that you need to honor the relationships that are closest and have been the most supportive of you.  I have officiated several weddings and have seen all different family members walk the bride down the aisle.  I wouldn't have your father walk you down and ""give you away"" if you do not have that close of relationship.  It is okay to have your brothers do this. You mentioned that your brothers have been there 100% and your father only 60%...  which may suggest some attachment and bonding with your father.  I would either have him escort your mother down the aisle or pre-seat the parents before hand.  The other option is to be escorted by your brothers and have your father walk behind you. Whatever you decide is alright.  Just don't be ""guilted"" into doing something you really don't want to do.  If you choose not to have your father involved in the ceremony, this may give an opportunity to sit down with him at another time and build a closer relationship.  Best Wishes!"

I had appetizers (such as potatoes with caviar, stuffed mushrooms, lamb chops, quiches, etc.) passed around by servers, and a help yourself dessert table with several cheesecakes, petite fours, candied nuts, surrounding a small wedding cake.  I also had a punch bowl on a table where people could help themselves to the non-alcoholic punch. The celebration was elegant and fun!

For the timeline... directly following the ceremony, we went straight into the first dance (which was the cue for the servers to begin with the drinks), then the dances with the parents.  While we danced, the servers continued to bring around champagne and wine for the guests, along with the appetizers.  The D.J./M.C. kept the party rolling.  

You reception sounds wonderful and elegant.  For appetizer ideas, you may want to go to some favorite restaurants and sample a few.   "

9780,26876,"Why don't you do a combination of both, or shades of blue, if you like blues. I think that you can combine dark blues with the light blues in their dresses, like if they have a sash. I would do the corn blue with a darker blue for a sash and vice versa for the maid of honor. I had shades of red's along with black and white for my colors. I think colors also make a difference on the style of dress you choose. And also think of what color will look good with all your bridesmaids. I know its a lot to think about, but I have been to a couple of weddings in which the color of the dress didn't go so well with one or two of the bridesmaid, and I bet they knew it as well. And I know its your wedding and all, but you also have to be considerate of your party. So, hopefully this helps, if not then maybe it'll help someone else, who has trouble deciding on colors."
9780,1779,"I don't think blue velvet is too dark for an August wedding.  In fact, I believe we shot a wedding with this exact color in July.  The bridesmaids had blue velvet dresses with bright hot pink and green flowers.  Really beautiful!  :)"
9785,8287,"An engagement party is to announce your engagement.  Although there is nothing wrong with waiting but it is rather mute to wait too long after being engaged because by then everyone knows you're engaged and you will be in the throes of wedding planning.  I would say not to wait any longer than 3 months to have the party.  An announcement needs to go out with an invitation to the party.

9725,50343,"The giving away at your wedding ceremony is a very personal choice. There is no ""rule"" that says it has to be a parent and in the end it is your wedding -- so do what feels right for YOU. 

I have had many brides be given away by their brothers or mothers rather than their fathers. If you would prefer to have your brothers walk you down the aisle you can still honour your father with the first dance, inviting him to speak at the reception or to do a reading at your ceremony.

Best of luck!

9757,50343,"Try to keep in mind that the moneybox will be looked at for the briefest of moments (while putting an envelope in the box/sack). But if you would prefer that your moneybox to stand out, in addition to the great ideas above here are some ideas:

An old-fashioned metal mailbox
A Birdhouse shaped like a home
A picnic basket decorated in vines or flowers
A simple coloured box with a slit in the top
A box wrapped like a wedding gift with a slit in the top
A large vase with petals or coloured stones in the bottom

"
9649,50343,"The great thing about summer weddings is anything goes. Here are some other colours and combos that work just as well for a summer wedding as the more traditional summer tones:

tiffany blue and brown
apple green and white
buttercreme yellow and ivory
lime and purple
light blue and brown
pink and green
pink and brown
orange and pink
poppy and pink
purple
royal blue and ivory
tan and ivory

Also keep in mind that there's no rule that you can't use dark colours. The trick is to pair it with a light undertone to lighten the effect. For example if you really like burgandy, try pairing it with ivory and a touch of pale pink for a dramatic, textured effect. If you like navy, add hints of royal blue, light blue and white.

Best wishes!

9663,52913,"Susie,
CUDOS to you for wanting to create a wedding on budget! As a wedding planner I LOVE to see brides (and grooms) wanting to go outside the box and save money on their special day. There are many low-budget alternatives that you can do yourself that are not expensive. Several ideas I'd like to offer you are using natural elements such as fruit, feathers, shells, or even branches. Compliment these elements with water, sand, or candles. Instead of flowers use petals to sprinkle on each table! Call your local florist or go online to order real or even artificial rose petals. Balloons are another alternative, when incorporated correctly! (You don't want your reception to look like a birthday party!smiles) Use them as arches over the head table or on long strings anchoring the room. 
When it comes down to it, use your imagination and creativity to make your day ""uniquely for you""! "

Mt husband and I were married there 08/11/07.  We were married in a historic church on the river walk;  LaValitta.  It was incredibly afforable and very convenient for all our guests as it was in walking distance to everything.

Here's our pics.  Good luck planning! "

9786,51708,"ok this is what I found when I was searching for answers. You are not suppose t have an engagment party no more then 4 months after you are engaged at this time it is still new. An engagment party is to anno. the engagment. Our wedding in the weekend after yours and we are having a party in March of 08!"
9820,52812,"Thanks very much, I will check that out.  Appreciate it."
9837,26876,"If your looking for shoes that will be high enough for your dress, I would think maybe some sort of platform type heels. If you got with just stilletto heels, your going to regret it afterwards, your back and feet and everything else will hate you for the torture. But, if you want the classic look, then platform will not be the way to go, and besides the last thing you want is to sprain your ankle or worse. So, I took a look at your dress online, and if its the same one I saw then I don't think the cost to alter it will be as expenisive as you think, its onlly costly for dresses with lots of layers and embroidery and if it has to be taken in as well. So try to get estimates from various places, I would stay away from bridal stores, because they will usually charge more than dry cleaners. You can even try going to like fabric stores and ask if there is anyone who has experience, and see if they can do something for you. I gave you a lot of info, but I hope something will help."
9836,26876,"A friend of mine got miniture suitcases, and put a map of the area, some coffee/tea, $5 metro cards and some other stuff, i can't remember. I thought it was soooo cute, and the guest really enjoyed them, I would have too had I gotten one. Im not sure what your budget is but I know she did spend a nice penny on them."
5464,39914,"Tyffany:

I can certainly understand what you feel. When I got engaged to my husband, we vowed not to have sex until marriage because we wanted to long for each other until I was a Mrs. 

Well, everything worked out fine. Our relationship was built on communicating well with each other. With not having sex in our relationship, we became deeper with one another on other levels. We were intimate, but in different ways. We ""dated"" more, we were affectionate more (but knew when to stop) and I think we just overall appreciated having a life without sex because we knew it would all come again on our wedding day. 

So, I think that as long as the two of you are on the same page...neither of you will stray. I applaud you with your efforts and I really wish the best for you. I'm not sure if you two are religious, but if you are...continued prayer is the answer while learning to appreciate each other more without the added pressure of sex. 

I hope this helps."
5697,39914,"Fiona:

I actually had my bridesmaids carry single calla lillies with white beads dangling...it was very classy. Having single flowers for you or the bride is up to you. If you like it, go with it. As with the other posts, calla lillies come in a variety of colors and you can't go wrong with them. If you wanted to break up the brown and red, maybe a white or cream calla lily might work.

I wish you the best of luck!"

968,20989,"I think Vanessa said it perfectly! There is a similiar post to this one on here, but I would like to reiterate-most brides that I have shot Trash The Dress sessions for had a FANTASTIC idea for a location for their portraits, but was too afraid to do it on the day of the wedding for fear of getting it dirty. In most cases, the dress is perfect after cleaning. You have spent too much money on a dress that is way too pretty to only wear it for one day and then let it suffocate in the back of your closet for the rest of its life!

So in my humble opinion, a TTD session and then donation is the best option to take. Whatever you choose, the most important thing is to get every last ounce of enjoyment out of a beautiful dress that you paid good money for. Decide what's important to YOU-fun photos, having an heirloom, or giving a less fortunate woman the gift of a beautiful dress. ALL are good choices, and you can never go wrong with following your heart!

Have fun making your choice!"
261,20989,"This doesn't help you too much now, but one of the best ways to help brides is to be there to help in the immediate days right before the wedding.  This will be a time where your sister will be pulling all the little details together, or maybe even just remembering or realizing a forgotten detail.  If you were planning on going out to California a few days before the day of the ceremony, I'm sure your sister will find a thousand small but invaluable ways that you can help her.

You are obviously a great sister!  Good luck to you both. "

9857,26876,"I think you should stick with VA, if you live there it may be easier for you to plan, rather than having to do it elsewhere, which may involove traveling back in fourth throughout your planning. You may have a wedding coordinator, but she/he can't do it all herself. I think if you guys live in VA, do it there. Your guest know you live there and I don't think they expect you to do anywhere else to accomodate everyone. Besides, you wont make everyone happy, there will always be someone unhappy with your decision. I know your trying to be accomdating to your guest, but you have to think about yourselves first and the stresses of planning a wedding. "

9847,26876,"I have posted to others that you should maybe pick out some flowers you like, orchids, tulips, roses, whatever you like. Then do some research on what colors they come in. Obviously roses come in all sorts of colors and tulips as well, most flowers do, but by working with a florist, they can tell you which flowers and colors can work with your budget as well. Or whats your favorite color(s)? Just because its June does not mean there are specific colors for a June wedding. Sometimes its easier to work with what you like then what the season is. "

9896,20989,"Keep in mind that a DJ or a band, if they do their job right, does more than simply provide music.  A good DJ or band announces the wedding party and the bride and groom, as well as other important announcements, and they keep the party going by playing the right music at the right time, by getting the crowd involved in the festivities of the night, etc.

If you are strapped for cash and need to use an iPod, I would suggest finding a friend that is both a music lover, and good in front of an audience, to be your DJ.  That way you have a person picking the right music for the right time, and you have someone to pick up the emcee duties of the evening.

Good luck with whatever you choose!"

It seems that the majority of the weddings I do these days, the men are already all up front with me, the MOH's and Bridesmaids walk in solo and then walk out together for the recessional.

As for playing the 'right' music -- if you load up your iPod with a wide variety of music -- you should do fine. 

Sure -- all of a sudden, the Electric Slide is going to come on, and half the people will go sit down -- but half the people will jump up from their seats screaming with delight. :-)

You list Florida -- and the date as 06/23/2012. Are those confirmed...or just something to fill in the required fields when you signed up?

What style of wedding? Formal? Informal? Big? Small?
Start thinking of some theme ideas.
Once the season is picked -- think about color choices.
Do you have a reception venue location in mind? We already had the venue picked out, and had to wait until they were even accepting reservations -- but it's good to get some upfront information, high level costs, etc so that you can start putting your budget together.

So good luck with school."
9896,26876,"You don't need to spend an arm and a leg on a DJ, especially if your considering your iPod instead, I would go on craigslist.com and look for someone who can do it for cheap, and they can always use your iPod and that would also be good for the DJ to see what kind of music your into.

I would have appreciated it, as it was a shock to see my order messed up.

Regardless, the invites still turned out very nice..even if it wasn't 100% what I wanted. For the price they were a great buy. So I am still happy with my invites...but not with the service.

Remember this is your wedding and you both need to decide what you both want.  Your mother would appreciate the input, but you need to let her work ""with you"".  Ask her opinion often but steer her more in your direction.  You will be amazed how easy it will be to get your mom to see things your way, if you have a definite idea.  Another thing to remember is look at your venue.  Use your venue to compliment your choices in colors and theme. "

As for the actual planning, it's hard to plan something with no real definites yet.  It may be helpful to start a notebook or a folder of ideas.  Every time you or your man sees something that you might like for your own wedding, put it in the folder.  After a while you'll start to see patterns emerging, and that will help you identify what it is that you two really want.  Once you've figured out a few of the definites, it'll be easier to pick out the other things.

Good luck and have fun with your planning!"

I work with brides to design the perfect label to convey their wedding theme or message.   The tins are great for travelers who want to freshen up a hotel room and add a favorite scent.

132,5924,"Soy candles are a great way to offer clean burning candlelight at your reception.  Our Premium Soy Tea Lights last an average of 7 hours and they are in clear cups so the flame and the color shines through.  The cups are made from certified polycarbonate and are recyclable in many areas.  Soy is good for guests who have allergies or are sensitive to the paraffin emissions (which I never new people were but I have a lot of customers who swear that they could never burn even unscented candles until they found soy).

9919,26876,"They say having an wedding planner is great...I wouldn't know because i opted not to have one. Instead I found someone on Craigslist who was just starting his business is wedding planning. He became involved in the very last stages, I guess you can say Day of Coordination. He didn't charge me anything and he was such a life saver. So if you want you can hire a wedding planner and hopefully they will save you some stress, or you can save some money and do it yourself. I had a great experience planning my own wedding, with both of my families and had lots of help. If your worried about costs maybe you can go on craigslist too and find someone who is just starting out and wont charge you or maybe just a small fee. Im  pretty sure your going to get lots of coordinators who are going to disagree with me, because they are coordinators, but it worked out for me and I don't regret getting my assistant for the day."

Use the organza bunched up around your topiaries and ""pull"" the focal point towards the center of the table instead of the whole table.  One great idea for a woodsy wedding is to purchase grass squares and use them as ""place mats"" under each setting with moss around your centerpieces.

actually you asked a really good question especially since so many people want to include everyone. The best thing to do, is get the groomsmen the same suits and ties.

9916,29631," There is nothing that is really required at your wedding Tanya and Matt. As I'm sure you're finding out as you plan your wedding there is no right or wrong, but just a lot of personal preferences. How you do your father/daughter or mother/son dance (provided you choose to do them) can depend on a variety of things. Do you or your parents feel uncomfortable in the spotlight or a you looking forward to that moment for just the two of you. If you are doing a lot of the ""special moment"" dances all at one time, too many may lose your guests attention.
   I hope this helps and best wishes!"
9957,48681,"I'm so sorry to hear that, Jennifer. Will he be walking you down the aisle? Perhaps, just a -- 'I'm glad you're here to share this day with us.' would suffice. You mentioned he's being a jerk about the wedding -- is that because he disapproves? If so, him being there may be his way of burying the hatchet and starting fresh.

Good luck!"
5476,50479,"I know this is biased coming from a photographer, but here's the thing about Bella. 

They're an agency, so they hire the same photographers that you can find on your own, or the ones who can't operate their own studio (this is not to say they're not good photographers-they have a good screening process, I believe). BUT the problem is that you'll end up paying more to hire them through the agency.

Posting photos online is nothing new. We do it, nearly all of our competitors do it. We DON'T send our prints to Walgreens because frankly, Walgreens sucks. We've done last minute prints with them a couple of times, and they 1) cropped awkwardly 2) messed with our color. My opinion is, if you're going to spend the money to get a professional photographer, get your prints done by a professional printer.

So my point is yes, Bella is good if you're looking for an easy way to find a good photographer, and you're OK with paying a bit more for the service. But in my opinion, there's a better way."

9907,20427,"As a wedding planner, I have to say, the responses you have gotten are great. The folder idea is a good one. 
Yes. You need to save. 
But while you are saving, you can build a guest list. It may change, some people might fall off, some might get added on, but I bet you can nail down the family, and most of your friends right now. That will give you a important number. The number of guests dictates a lot of things. If you want to do some real, down and dirty planning type stuff, you can start looking at venues. Go visit them. Take tours. Get some pamphlets to add to your folder. You might even get pricing. Colors are important too. After you pick a season like was suggested earlier, you can visit florists and see what kind of flowers are in season then. You can go during each season to actually see the flowers. Smell the flowers. You don't want anything that smells to strongly in case your guests are allergic. Allergy attacks during your reception are not fun. Hope that helps! "

9963,52913,"My only advice would be is to get an understanding with the reception site. If you are unable to get the church for your ceremony site, be sure that they can accomodate you for both the ceremony and reception.

The dresses are surprisingly well made for the price and I really love one (in that it is more my style).  You are not able to return them to the store - have to ship back - but I will gladly pay to ship the other 4 back and only spend $89 on the dress.  "
9957,26876,"I have to disagree with the fact that you said it was the right thing to do. Gifts are given to show your appreciation, not because you feel obligated to do so. If your going to give someone a gift knowing you don't feel they deserve it then don't...thats the right thing to do. I know most parents don't expect a gift anyway. Well anyway, I would just hand out the gifts and just say a special thanks in general, and enclose a personal thanks in a nice card or letter to your attendants. "

Another idea for a budget conscious centerpiece are low bowls with river rock or polished rocks on the bottom, a few cymbidium orchids resting on the rocks and tea lights floating on the water in them.  They are simple to put together.

I don't think the current wording looks like you left your mom out.  If anything it looks like his parents are divorced.  You can also drop the Mr and Mrs on  your parents and put both their first names.

9757,42429,"My florist took a large fish bowl and put our names on it and two little fish kissing.  Although we got married at the beach and our center pieces were fish, we did not have a beach theme.  But this was completely cute and appropriate. It now holds my bouquet and other small items from the wedding. Have fun with it! 
Another suggestion which I never thought of until someone mentioned it to me, make it something that somebody can't just walk by and pick a card out of.  Like an open box is easy to grab out of, especially if you are having the reception at a public place.  I know it sounds horrible but people do take cards because they more than likely have money in them.
Hope this helps.

9957,25370,"There can be a lot of pressure and stress during wedding planning (and many long term feelings and issues do surface at this time).  You have to do what you feel is in your heart and where you would like your relationship to go in the future.  The day of your wedding is not the day you probably want to make a strong statement and make him feel bad.  From my personal experience, I would give him a gift, thank him for being there (giving you away if he is) and just make it as warm as you can.  Turn it into a positive (and maybe will help your relationship in the future).  Congratulations and enjoy your day (and your marriage)! "
9907,25370,"I think all of us dream about our wedding day.  I had a notebook and took notes on the different locations, djs, bands, florists, dress designers, limousine companies and more.  If your friends are getting married (or family) make sure you get the business cards of vendors you liked at these affairs.  When you do get engaged, you will have an idea what you like and don't like.

And saving is obviously key since a wedding (and future) is expensive.  One thing my husband and I did was starting throwing loose change in a jar a few years before.  To our surprise, we saved enough for most of our honeymoon!    "

We both decided that we were going to have our reception at St. Arnold's Brewery in Houston.  Everything was planned after and around that.  We didn't decide on a ceremony site until just recently (a month or two later).  For us the reception site was the most important part of the planning, simply because that is where we will spend most of the day.

9919,50479,"I think the decision to hire a planner or not really depends on how hands-on you want to be. If you are OK with doing lots of research on your own and figuring out all of the details, I'd go without (that's what we're doing). BUT if you don't have a lot of time or patience for such things, a planner is awesome. 

And one thing to keep in mind is that even though they'll charge you, there's a good chance they'll help save you money in the end. Vendors (like us) partner up with planners and offer discounts to their clients. Also, they know weddings well, so they can offer lots of advice on how to save money without sacrificing style."

Maybe your stepfather can start with you & they switch half way down the aisle & your real father takes you to the alter.  My friend did something like that with her 3 sons.  She started with one then he handed her off then the older son walked her to the alter.It didn't sound good at first but it looked really nice. Or you do it the opposite way since you real dad was first in your life. "
9945,11213,"My opinion is that your son should walk you down the aisle.  He's the most important man in your life even though he's only 7.  I'm sure it would put a big smile on his face, how cute would that be."

9907,53835,"see if there are any wedding expo's in your area that are going on in the future. some of them have cake flavors that you can taste, dresses, and local venders for things like venues, florists, bakers, rental companies and more. you can add all of the things that you like to you folder and you will have them for later. that way you have down the things that you know that you are ganna like and want at your wedding."
10009,1779,"Your officiant might have a preferred method... but this is what I see most often.

Parents are seated.
Groomsmen either walk down the aisle behind the officiant with the groom last or they walk in from the front of the church.
Then bridesmaids, flower girl, ring bearer, and finally bride.

I've also seen it where the groom walks down the aisle with his parents and the groomsmen each walk in with a bridesmaid.

hope that helps!"
10003,54523,"have both of your dads escort you. one on both sides it will work out great"
9941,54523,"let both of them do it you could use all the help you need

10011,39625,"You should never request monetary gifts, but what you can do is let siblings, and parents know that's what you prefer money, since you're both already settled. They can let your guests know by word of mouth. 
Good Luck :)"
10014,39625,"Typically a gown is already bustleable, and their are two kinds, French and Austrian. You should ask the bridal salon if you dress has a bustle, and to show you how to bustle it (bring a bridesmaid or maid of honor, because they'll be the one bustling the day of the wedding). Also, if you have an extremely long train, it may also just be detachable. If that's not the case sometimes they can add a bustle, depending on the silhouette. So be sure to ask :)
Good Luck!"
10011,26876,"If you are not registered any where then that would make it easier for your guests to decide on money as a gift. Most likely they will ask you or even others to find out where you are registered, once they figure out your not registered they will get a clue...I hope."
10003,26876,"Maybe have one of your dads walk you halfway, and then switch. I've seen that done before, and both were happy."
10013,26876,"I think if you add lots of greenery with your arrangements it should be fine. Also, if you go to a craft store that sells silf florals, you can find what i would describe as stems that look like they have berries in them, they usually come in gold and silver, you can purchase these and provide them to your florist to incorporate into your arrangements. But, greens will never go worng when you have whites and off whites. "
10006,26876,"When you say decorations what are you refering to? Flowers?
I remember your previous post regarding the dresses and the colors. Silver will work or even white, and it will only accent the cornflower  blue rather than be another color in your color scheme. For flowers there are all sorts of flowers that come in blues like hydrangea those are gorgeous. Like I said before as well, why not shades of blues? "

Wedding planners are there to bring your ideas and fantasies to reality and MOST planners will help you save money. "
5276,48474,"No, you don't have to provide favors, but it is expected.

To make it more affordable think about your guests.  Are most of them coming as couples?  Are you having a sit down dinner?

You could place the favors at every other place setting or provide enough favors to give to your female guests.  In my experience, the only men I see with a favor is holding it for his wife or girlfriend.

Processional with go:
Mother of parents of the groom
Mother of the bride
After the parents are seated the 
Groom with enter with the officiant by himself or with the groomsmen
from the side.....or down the aisle depending on the church or venue
Bridesmaids (*With or Without the groomsmen)
Ring bearer flower girl
Maid or matron of honor

10003,26987,"To give reverence to both I would have your officiant ask the other Dad who did not walk you down the isle to stand and give you away as well.

How this works:

You would walk down the isle and stop at the end and the officiant will say:

""Will ______ (other Dad) please stand""?

Optional ""Will________(other dad)  & _________(mom) please stand""?  

The officiant will say "" Who presents this women to be married to this man?  They will all respond with ""We Do""  Each person will have their moment.

You also may present a roses to all parents durring the ceremony with words of appreciation."
10023,26987,"It is not necessary for the moms to light the canldes. Often the wording for the unity candle is about two families two seperate lives that are joined as one. 

So the officiant will say  ""______Groom &______ Bride please light the outer candles representing all that you were, and all that you are and together light the center candle representing all that you shall become together"" 

You may opt for a sand ceremony instead.
 Blending of Sand
_______ and _______, you have just sealed your relationship by the giving and receiving of rings 
 The most beautiful example of this partnership 
is the marriage relationship. 
You have committed here today to share the rest of your lives with each other.
 Today, this relationship is symbolized through 
the pouring of these two individual containers of sand one, 
Please pour the two containers into one
Representing and all that you were, 
all that you are, 
and all that you will ever be, 
As these two containers of sand are poured into the third container, 
the individual containers of sand beome interwoven
joined together as one. 
Two lives, 
two hearts 
joined together in friendship 
united forever in love. "
10013,53750,"Green is a good option.  However, a burnt or pale orange color would accent the ivory, white and gold colors as well."
10006,53750,"I agree, brown looks great with brown.  A beige or off white color would also compliment it."
9851,26987,"I agree with Melissa

So on the processional

I would have the Best Man come out with the Officiant and the Groom.
It will go:
Officiant
Groom
Best Man

It is always good for the groom to have his ""wing-man"" up there with him.

Then:

The Maid of honor
The Matron of honor
The bride with (escort) person giving you away. 

On the recessional

The two of you will walk out 1st

10023,20989,"I shot a wedding this summer that had a sand ceremony in place of a unity candle and it was beautiful. When the mothers were escorted in they carried a small glass vase of colored sand down to the front where a table was set up with a large empty vase. In the ceremony, the bride and groom each took their vase of sand and poured it into the large vase. It was the same concept of a unity candle, but much prettier (there are pictures on my flick page http://www.flickr.com/photos/perezsisters/sets/72157602176929349 if you want to look) 

This could help you because you could have both his mom and his stepmom with a vase, and they could combine the sand at the table. They wouldn't even have to come up at the same time, one could come up after the other. This way nobody can be offended, and they each play an equal part in the ceremony. 

Hope this helps! (If this is something you're interested in email me and I can give you some helpful tips on how to make it work.)"
10028,20989,"A very good friend of mine is from Rancho Cucamonga, and when we got married he had his reception at a local college (I'm sorry, I don't remember which one).

10028,20427,"Flowers are easy. Use filler flowers. Stuff that florists have in huge amounts and costs practically nothing. Baby's Breath and stuff like that. if done right it can look really elegant. If you do use other flowers, choose things that grow in CA and are in season. No huge importation bills that way. And keep it simple. No one says you need to decorate the ends of every pew in the church. No one says your bridesmaids have to carry flowers. If they are already buying purses to match their dresses, they can carry them down the aisle. Also, have your girls do their own hair and makeup, or have a friend do it. No reason to spend hundreds of dollars at a salon. Instead of flower centerpieces, use candles. Candles are cheap. You can get votive holders cheap at Ikea, or Michael's or AC Moore. And the soft light gives things a more romantic feel. Some caterers will let you rent mirrors. If you set candles on top of mirrors, that tends to look really good."
10028,26876,"You can use store bought, invites. They don't have to look cheap, that depends on which ones you choose. I bought mines, because I couldn't find anything else I liked. There's a picture of it in my photo gallery here, if you want to see. And if you think about it, people throw them away anyway. Try to make your own favors, rather then buying them, Im not sur if there is a Michaels there its a craft and silk floral store, they sell tons of stuff for weddings. Veils, you can find on Ebay for cheap. I know the day you choose can affect your costs dramatically, like a friday can be a couple thousands cheaper than a Sat. Make your own Save-the-Dates as well. I mean there are tons of things you can do yourself, thats only if you want to. Send me a message if you want anymore advice, I did a lot of the things myself at my wedding, so I have a good idea."

9734,36988,"I think you need to put the wedding location on the invitations.  People need to make travel plans ahead of time, depending on where they are coming from.  I'm sure you will have people who do not RSVP (it happens to everyone!).  When your ""RSVP by"" date expires have a bridesmaid or parent help you call guests to find out if they are able to make it or not.

Happy planning!

"
5276,26987,"I agree most expect it.  Your guests will have taken the time to pick out a gift for the two of you, and it is a nice token for your appreciation.

Here is just one poem, more can be found online.

More than kisses so far weve shared,
Our home has been made with Love and Care,
Most things we need weve already got,
And in our home we cant fit a lot!
A wishing well we thought would be great,
But only if you wish to participate,
A gift of money is placed in the well,
Then make a wish  but shhh dont tell!
While enjoying our honeymoon well feel brand new,
We can look back and say it was all thanks to you!

A wishing well will be on display at the reception 
Where we can receive your best wishes.

10047,39625,"Hi Erin, 
are you using a caterer? or doing things on your own?
If you're using a caterer, you can always tell them your total food budget and let them work out everything. Or if you're doing everything on your own...you can have assorted bagels, breakfast pastries, eggs - Florentine, Scrambled or even have Eggs Benedict.  If you would let me know what route your going I may be able to help you out with ideas and recipes!
Good Luck :)"
10028,52913,"My advice would be to shop online, in clearance bins at your local craft stores, or even at the flea market! Several websites that are awesome with wedding items are: www.orientaltrading.com (great buys on invitations, bouquets, favors, etc), www.ebay.com, and 
www.sav-on-crafts.com to name a few. 
First of all, choose a theme and stay with it. Its amazing how you can save money and stay within your budget when you stick with a theme! Use other economical ways such as candles, mirrors, fruit, and artificial flower petals as tablescapes. When you take simple and put it together with your decor it can turn out to be very elegant. Instead of a DJ, have several CDs playing in the background of the reception on a continuous basis. Check out your local grocery store for deals on wedding cakes, too! I chose a three-tier cake for my wedding and had a sheet cake made with individual roses on each square. I paid about $150.00 for the cake to feed over 200 people!!"

10046,20427,"Ushers are unnessasary unless you have special seating for certain people or you are sticking to the traditional, bride on one side groom on the other thing. "
10009,20427,"This can be confusing because we have seen it so many different ways. In a traditional Christian ceremony, the groom enters with the best man from the front. This can be a problem if a venue has no where for the men to wait up front, in which case they tend to follow the officiant down the aisle. In a tradional Jewish ceremony the groom is walked down the aisle with his parents. "
10023,20427,"I agree that the sande ceremony could be very nice. His Dad, and Both Mothers could have different colors, and pour them into one glass, thus creating him, and your parents do you, and then the final glass will have 5 or 6 different colors in it. (6 if you have the priest pour white sand to represent God's place in your new life. Thats popular with the religious ceremonies)"
10047,53835,"some easy ideas are maybe some crepes with jelly, mini sandwiches, and pastries. you can try egg sandwiches or cheese and crackers. "
10028,31333,"I'm having that same dilema myself, but I found a book on Barnes & Noble's website called ""Priceless Weddings for Under $5,000.""  It gives you tips on how to cut corners and save money.  I'm still reading it, but so far so good!  It was less than $15 I think.  That might be a good investment!"
10003,18635,"I posted the same scenario in October.  All of the answers given are great.  My initial thought was to have them escort me together.  My father was not happy.  He told me he would let me know in a few weeks.  I didn't hear from him or he had a reason not to get into the conversation.  He finally said they could share the duty with him actually giving me away.  He did say ""Who knows my thoughts may change""  That meant he knew how much it meant to me and he would consider doing it together.  There's time though. However, it is very important that both of these men realize that YOU should NOT have to compromise.  It is YOUR wedding and love them both.  Each have contributed to who you are.  "
10054,20427,"Its your wedding. Any colors would work. I tend to stay with a three color palette. A dark color, a lighter of the same color, and a third accent color, thats not on the same side of the spectrum. Like, Hunter Green, Sage Green, and Egg Shell. Or Royal Purple, Lilac, and Sunshine. Or Sapphire Blue, Baby Blue, and tan. Thats how I choose colors at least. "
10046,26987,"If you have ""open seating""  not a traditional  Bride Side, Groom Side,
you will not need an usher.  However if you have someone handing out programs, or someone at the guest sign in area, you may want them to instruct the guests that the seating is open.

Typically the Father/Daughter dance and Mother/Son dance are done as separate dances because typically the bride and groom have picked out a song that is unique to their relationships towards their respective Father and Mother...  They can be done as a single dance.  It really is up to you how you wish to honor your parents.

I will say that my daughter had surgery for a broken ankle and spent about 2 months in bed searching online for a dress.  We were finally able to get to the actual store to see the dress she liked on the website.  Luckily she did not buy online because the back of the dress looked totally different in person and she hated it!  David's Bridal is also famous for adding colored ribbon sashes to their wedding dresses for the photos online which can make a dress appear to be totally different than it looks in person.  The dress my daughter ended up buying was one she had totally hated online because it had a purple ribbon around the waist.  Online photos are sometimes deceiving!  Good Luck!"
9907,54907,"How fabulous that you are starting so early rather than waiting till the last minute. A date to keep in mind is approximately 12 months prior to the date you plan to walk down the aisle. That's when you really need to start to PLAN! Until then, enjoy all the wedding regala around you....rip pics from magazines, print stories off the internet, take pictures of sites that interest you for locations. Put it all together in sheet protectors and then in a 3 ring binder so that you won't have to scramble thru the thousand pieces of paper you will have by then. And as prepared as you are, always remember that the ideas can be yours, but the work can be done by a great wedding planner! Good luck .... you'll have too much fun now and then again when the big day rolls around!"
10013,54907,"Yep, green and various shades of green in the centerpieces, bouquets, ribbons, along the aisle runner .... that all works. If you use all shades of white and ivory, you will compliment and contrast with all of the items, rather than clash with them. You can even use any color on the scale from light ivory to gold. Ask your florist or whoever is supplying your linens to show you a color wheel and you'll find many colors between that spectrum. Have fun!"
9919,54907,"I wish that I had had one........and now I am one, so I'm partial to saying yes! The on-going thread here is that planning a wedding is VERY stressful, from planning the smallest details to keeping Aunt Martha away from the vodka luge to making sure everyone just knows which way to walk down the aisle. You are getting very close to W-day and if you have the majority of details locked up, you can surely have a wonderful day finishing the plans yourself. If you have a full-time job, a large wedding or wedding party, or family is becoming an issue, you might consider a planner just so that you will have someone to make decisions in your best interest, take the pressure off, and allow you to just show up!"

133,26987,"Misty,  you may want to think about all the elements that you want for your renewal.  Oceanside, or in the Mountains, or in Wine Country.
Once you have a better vision......it will help you pick the perfect spot!  If you invite family you may want to pick a place close to airports to cut down on car rentals and expensive air fare. Also since you are already married anyone can perform the renewal. Some couples want a professional for vow renewals and since there is no license to file you may get a better rate. 

Mountain & Lakeside-Lake Tohoe (summer is short they can get snow in June) Fly in to Reno and take hotel transporation to hotels

Oceanside- San Diego family can take in the Zoo, Seaword, and the Ocean. Fly right in.....

Wine Country- Sonoma County, vinyards, rolling hills, horse country, keep in mind the time of year ...(your green grass may be gone).

I did not take my husbands name, (for reasons that are clear when you know his last name) and people are still confused on how to write out our Christmas card 10 years later.I think that you are on the right track keeping your name and adding his.

10054,20989,"Most F3bruary weddings are black and white and red (red of course because of Valentines) and so it might be cool to do the black and white - and then choose a different accent color.  So it's similiar to most weddings at the time, but with a very important difference.  Colors that go well with black and white are easy to find and run the gamut from lime green to royal purple and a lot of colors in between.

Or you could do a winter wedding color scheme and go midnight blue with silver accents.

Your best bet might be to decide your theme, and then go from there.

Good luck choosing - there are so many great colors out there you can have fun going with the colors that you love best."

You may have luck trying zappos.com - they usually have a large selection of different shoes.

I bought my own wedding shoes on eBay - but I got married in 5.5"" white flip flops, so I really wasn't going to find mine anywhere else!  But if you're having trouble finding the exact style you want, eBay might be a good place to look.

Good luck with your search!"
10088,26876,"Well, does he see the problem that your having on find a nice venue? Maybe he doesn't care to have a nice wedding as long as his guests are there. I would definately tell him, that it seems very unfair that he is not willing to compromise, after you made a cut on your guest list to be able to have a decent wedding. Or ask him if he is willing to put in more money? Have you also considered a friday? Somestimes Fridays can be even cheaper then on a Sunday. I would ask him what he had in mind when he invisions your wedding day, maybe this will give you an opportunity bring him to back to reality. Good luck I hope everything works out."
10098,52913,"It is appropriate to write the name or names of the guest invited to the wedding. Use the appropriate titles as Mr, Miss, or Mrs. of that person. You DO NOT want to prefill the number of guests on your reply cards. Normally, if that person is single you can expect them to bring one additional guest. If they are married and have children (under the age of 18) in the household, you can expect them to be added, too! 
I like to get a small file box, a set of alphabetical index cards, and plain 3x5 index cards to list the names of each person I send an invitation to along with their address, phone number, and names of children (under the age of 18). As your reply cards arrive, mark an ""A"" for acceptance and ""R"" for regret. Then you can have an accurate number of guests.
I know this exceeded what you asked, but I hope this helps anyway!

10104,20989,"I think going with navy and silver is an excellent idea! ;)

Jennifer gave you some great advice on your other post - stick with a three color palette that consists of a dark color, a light version of that same color, and a third accent color.  So in this case that would be your navy as your main color, and your silver as the last accent color.  So your secondary accent color would be any light blue that you like with navy blue - slate blue and cornflower blue are good choices.  Those blues have grey in them, so they would go nicely with both the navy and the silver.

Hope this helps!"

5605,13708,"I'm not sure how reliable ""resort"" photographers are, but in most cases your wedding planner shoudl be able to direct you to a reputable wedding photographer at your destination.  For example, I'm a wedding planner in Vieques, Puerto Rico, and I have three different really good photographers that I offer to my brides as choices.  All three have extensive websites and lots of references (many of them former clients of mine that I hook up with each other for referrals).  So don't automatically assume that you have to go to the expense of importing a photog -- you can probably find one where you're getting married if you make a few phone calls or are using a wedding planner.  It is NEVER cheaper for one of my brides to bring a photographer with them unless the photographer is a wedding guest and is shooting the wedding for free.

10028,55504,"Venues usually take up a huge amount of your wedding budget.  If you are able to hold the ceremony at a private residence (the home one of your relatives or friends), that will save a ton of money.  

Consider renting your wedding dress rather than buying.  Times have changed since daughters used to wear their mother's wedding dress.  Hardly anyone does that anymore.  So, since you will most likely not be passing down the dress, nor ever wearing it again, if you rent instead of buy, you can save hundreds of dollars easily.  

As a wedding photographer, I am clearly biased when it comes to not skimping on documenting your wedding with quality photography with archival-quality prints and albums.  But... just ask anyone who cut corners on their photography and later wished they had something decent to remember their big day with.

By the way... I am also located in Southern California (Murrieta, near Temecula).

I was brought up, that if you do not see a name on the inside envelope of a family member, you can assume that they are NOT invited.  I would never assume that they meant to invite my children.  

I did have an unusual situatuion when a male cousin invited me to his wedding and on the inside envelope they wrote my name, my fiance's name and my daughter's name.  Well I also have two sons that do not live with me, so I checked with my son's first to find out if they received an invitation (they had not).  I ""assumed"" that they were invited because their sister was invited, and maybe they forgot to put it on the envelope.  So, I checked with the groom's mother for verification and yes, they had meant to put my son's names on their as well.  So I was able to reply appropriately.

9919,13708,"You get what you pay for.  If you are having a wedding in your hometown and you have time to deal with all the little details yourself, or your mom wants to do it for you, then a person to coordinate things on the day of your wedding may be all that you need.  But if you're having a destination wedding, you need to hire a real experienced wedding planner if you want things to go off alright.  Remember, somebody you hire for the day of cannot fix any problems with your vendors.  You set it all up, and the day of person doesn't have any clout or authority to deal with those vendors.

A professional will take a fee from you (usually based on a percentage of your overall budget) or they will take a percentage from the vendors -- but they shouldn't get paid on both sides.  Make sure you ask about that before hiring someone.

Good luck!

10088,50366,"I had a problem with inviting a lot of children.  I have cousins that have lots of children, and although I would LOVE to see them all our venue just can't handle that many people and does not have a lot of room for children to ""be children""...SO I asked my first cousin about this because I knew that she would be ""brutally honest"".  She asked me why should I pay for a ""family reunion""??  That was my ""aha moment""!! 

So, I decided that I would cut out any children that were not my ""first cousins"" children and let the chips fall where they may.  I cut out around 25 little people that way.  I also decided to put on my ""save the date"" cards a little line that said, if you already have plans for our wedding date, please kindly send us an email to let us know.  That way I can invite more people that are on the ""B"" list.
I also made the decision to plan a family reunion for the following summer, so that there would be a time that we COULD all get together without me footing the bill.

10123,26876,"You don't normally say casual wedding on a wedding invite, people usually mention attire when its formal, they'll usually say black tie welcomed or something along those lines. I think also, the invites you choose and the wording on them also set the tone for the wedding, so if you have a very elegant invite, with elegant font, your guest may pick up its a formal event. If your still unsure, you can always have your immediate family and wedding party spread the word as well. "
5548,13708,"It's not okay to invite anybody to the bridal shower who won't be invited to the wedding or reception.  I had a destination wedding with very few of my family and only our closest friends, but then we came back to DC and had a big formal wedding reception.  Only people who had been invited to either the destination wedding or the formal reception were invited to pre-wedding activities such as the engagement party and the bridal showers.

Yes, people will be offended if you invite them to a bridal shower for a wedding they're not invited to.  And they should be.  It's like begging for wedding gifts.  Tacky tacky tacky.

If your colleagues at work decide to surprise you with a shower, or something like that, then it's fine to accept the gifts without inviting those people to the wedding.  But don't plan a bridal shower for guests who aren't invited to your wedding  Just don't do it.

Your guests will understand if you don't invite children, especially with your budget. It's not fair that you have to cut your guest list of adults who would love to be there for kids who could careless. 30 children is A LOT-keep in mind you want your adult guests to have a good time and with that many kids, it could be difficult.

If you want to find someone to marry and go along with the wedding theme, I suggest you see if you can find a close friend of yours and have them temporarily certified to marry you.  I am not sure if all states do it, but I would think Vegas would be the perfect place for it.  My fiance and I are actually attempting to have her uncle marry us here.

To me those are the best tips!"
10123,20989,"It is considered good etiquette not to put that type of thing in the invitation itself, as many here have told you.  However, you're already bucking tradition by having a casual wedding anyway, and your invitations will already be less formal than normal.  So given the circumstances, I think it would be acceptable to have something about the dress in with the invitation.

Depending on what type of invites you are going with, you may want to put the wording either: on the reception information insert (and then you can say something along the lines of ""extremely casual reception immediately following the ceremony"") or make an entirely new insert specifically for informing people.

I think people assume a level of formaility with a wedding, and if you want your guests to be informal, you'll have to let them know that in no uncertain terms.

Hope this helps!  Good luck with whatever you choose to do."

I know in New York state, as long as there is someone who is a liscensed officiant there at your wedding to oversee, he or she does not actually have to be the one to perform the service.  So you might be able to actually have a friend ""perform"" the ceremony under the officiant's guidance and supervision.

Although, since you're getting married in Vegas, that's probably the easiest place in the world to find an officiant who wouldn't mind being in costume!

I also agree with JD that I would LOVE to shoot your wedding!  It sounds like so much fun.  If you are looking for a photographer, we would be willing to shoot your wedding for just the travel expenses.

Or you can also use word of mouth. I had the same problem, so I know how you feel about it.

Im guessing maybe its the whole thing about, your marrying our son, but we just met you sort of thing. Normally, you meet the in laws before you get engaged. If their the traditional type of people, I guess they may be a little hurt by the situation. The best thing to do is to talk to your fiance, ask him if he noticed it as well, and how he feels. I wouldn't try to let them get on your nerves, the best thing to do is try to win them over at this point, after all your marrying into his family as well. You have plenty of time to try to establish some sort of relationship before you get married. Good Luck. "

I agree that it is weird. You might want to talk to Matt, and make sure he's announced your engagement. I would feel uneasy if I were in you shoes.
And if for some reason he's forgotten to, you can always send out an engagement announcement. If he has, and his parents just prefer not to meddle, then that's fine too. My mother-in-law was worried about giving me her opinion so she never said anything, when I made it clear that I wanted to know what she thought about things - she never stopped making suggestions, which made me feel much better about things. Just talk to Matt, and see what's going on. I'm sure things will all work out!

10125,50441,"I think the answer has been stated pretty clearly but I agree as well.  It seems odd that she would make a decision like that without at least consulting the two of you.  It's your wedding not hers.  You and your fiance should sit down together and discuss the officiant.  That is after all what marriage is supposed to be, right?"
10162,54821,"I have seen this done by simply adding the word ""adult"" on the reception card or area of the invitation.

Adult reception to follow
Time
Location

It might not be traditional or ""proper,"" but if you've got to do it, you've got to do it. 
"
10073,50441,"I know I am throwing a different answer out here but I believe if you are writing in prose, it should look like;

Joe bought the ring
And 
Kaylin said yes!
There's going to be a wedding,
We hope you'll be our guest!

Of course that's mostly just my opinion.  Best place to get advice, is to read some old prose.  Take a look at some of Shakespeare's stuff."
10162,20989,"I think you should put it on the invitation. There's lots of traditions that just don't make sense in our modern times, and in your case it's more important to make sure everyone is fully aware of your desires than following tradition just for tradition's sake.

Some people with children need to be told in no uncertain terms that something is adult-only, or they simply assume if they're invited, their children are too. I've seen this at countless events I've photographed. It's too risky to assume word-of-mouth or your wedding website will be sufficient. Plus, you want people to know upfront rather than be hurt of offended by assuming their kids were invited and then hearing later that they're not.

You can have your reception information on an insert that you put in with the main invitation rather than having it on the invitation itself. At least the info will be there and your main invitation can be as traditional as you want.

Good luck and have fun with your invitations!"
10162,53299,"This is the simplest way I have seen it done. 

Please reply before the first of June 

M___________________________ 
_________Will attend 
_________Will not attend 

Number of adults_____

If someone puts on there that they want their kids to come then you will need to call and tell them that it is an ""adults only"" reception."
10125,53299,"Since you are the two that are getting married and you are the two that will have to most contact, if not all of the contact with the priest. YOU are the ones who should decide which priest will officiate the wedding."

Also, Sandles is a really nice resort and they offer great deals and returns if a Hurricane was to come out of no where. If your interest email me and let me know, I think I have a travel agent number for Sandles around here somewhere.  If you want I'll look for it.

10190,30374,"Hello Bradley

You have your basic tradition wedding entertainment. You can have praise dancers come and do a piece.Someone to sing a song. There are a lot of little neat things you can do."
10182,30374,"Hello shellZoe

I am a wedding planner and travel agent. Have you been to Antigua, Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands, Fiji, Tahiti, Etherland which is in the caribbean and have pastel pink sand on the beaches. There are different parts of the Bahamas as well that have some exclusive resorts which are all-inclusive other than Nassu. What about Bermuda, Virgin Islands. How about the Rivera Maya and take a look at palace resorts. Please give me a call. I would like to help you futher with this 803-528-1032."
10158,30374,"Yes that is weird not to even ask about how the wedding is going. They should have embrace you a little bit more. Have you ask him how his family really feels about all of this. Not that matter to point of saying okay we are not getting married, but just to know."
9919,30374,"Hello Inna

I would like to help you plan your special day. Please give me a call at 803-528-1032"
1095,45138,"I do not know if this response is too late for you or if it will help, but hopefully it will help someone.

We are getting married in Virgin Islands. Of course you feel more than obligated to pay for your attendants accomadations for a few nights, so to cut costs we rented a villa on the beach and we are free to have our wedding there for FREE!

We are going the very first week when summer starts, prices of accomadations drop drastically. If you rent a villa it is usually cheaper by person and you get a beach view all the time. Check it out, it may be cheaper than you think. So we got a 4 bedroom for around $3600.  That breaks down to $450 a person ofr A FULL WEEK! You can negotiage that if the others do not stay in the villa the full time that they drop the rate and pro-rate for you. Say you stay for 7 days and everyone else stays for 4. "
10177,26876," I don't think you have to, unless you know they have been together for a while, then it would be a bit rude, but other than that no. But who wants to pay for an extra mouth they dont know right?"
10179,26876,"Have you tried calling the company who sells it? I think they would be maybe more helpful."
10177,20989,"Of course you don't have to.  But...how much fun is it to go to a wedding alone?  Unless you know this person is going to have other people at your wedding that they know, and you're sitting this person with those people, it would be nice of you to invite their date for the sake of your guest.

Is it that you don't want a person there that you don't know, or is it that you do know this person and you don't want them there?"
10123,55927,"I would put it on the very bottom of the invitation like this:

            Casual Attire Requested!

I'm sure you'll find that everyone is going to love that part!"
10046,55927,"Trust me even if you have ushers people will still seat themselves. The ushers won't know everybody and when family member see other memebers or friends, they are going to change their seating."
9916,55927,"I would do it seperate.  No rush to do them both at the same time.
Enjoy watching each other dance.

For bride & father dance-""A Song For My Daughter"" or ""Daddy's Little Girl"" They are great wedding songs and you must hear them.

For the mother & son- ""Sweet Angel Of Mine"" by Kassie Depaiva

Good Luck! "
5306,55927,"I would go with the one who's going to be there for YOU!
This is your day, don't stress about your friends.  Who ever you think can be there mostly for you. 

I think in your heart you know the answer but your being ture to your friend and that's so sweet. But this is your moment and you should enjoy it. If she's a ture friend she'll realize that.

Good Luck!"
10142,55927,"I'm a wedding photographer, and I don't expect a tip.  You pay enough in your wedding package.
However, the Housekeeping I would tip. And the bag boys or valet parking.  Now they do expect tips.
I know at my wedding and all my bride's that I work with, we used the money from the dollar dance. If you weren't going to do that then I would rethink it because you can really make alot of money. My husband and I made around $900.00. And one of my bride's made $3,000. You can use that money to enjoy your selfs and not stress about it coming out of your pocket.

Good Luck!"
3868,55124,"If it doesn't matter to you what part of Mexico in specific... I'd suggest any of the Riu Resorts.  My fiance proposed when we were on a Mexican Cruise which took us to 3 ports, Cabos San Lucas, Mazitlan, and Puerto Vallarta.  I have to say, Puerto Vallarta was absolutley beautiful!  We enjoyed the town and have since decided to host our wedding at the Riu Vallarta Resort (5 stars)... It is also near by to it's other location Riu Jalisco which our guests can go and stop by with their bands to recieve free drinks, etc.  Our wedding package for about 45 people is over $2,000 and so far our planning has been going fine.  The only thing is there only seems to be one wedding coordinator handling everything for their two locations, therefore her responses have been helpful, but slow.

http://www.weddingsbyriu.com/doc/royal_mexico08.pdf

Good luck!"
10054,55927,"I would go with spring colors or maybe light purple.  That'll be really nice and different from everyone else.

Good Luck!"
10047,55927,"You know what your going to be so busy that day, don't try to cook.  I would go to Olive Garden, for the unlimited salad dish ($5.95) 
I don't know where your at or if they have it near you.  However, I do know it's a west coast special.  Look into it.

Good Luck "
10023,55927,"As a photographer I have seen it many different ways.  You can have the fathers do it.  Or at my wedding I did my mother and his father.

Good Luck!"
5605,55927,"You know not only as a photographer but as a past bride, you really must talk with your photographer. Not just through emails but on the phone.  Really get to know them. 
I think you should pick a local photographer and see how they work with you on your engagement shoot.
When you go with the resorts they don't know you and do regular job. And there's many different photographers. How do you know who photograph all the photos on the web site? 
When you find a photographer you build a friendship.  They know what you like and what you don't.

It's also less expensive to pick a local photographer.  Take a look at their specials and look around!

Good Luck!"
10011,45138,"I searched Google for ""cash wedding registry"" and ""Honeymoon wedding resitry"" 
I got a lot of good links. Some sites let you accept cash or stock, some let guests contribute to your honeymoon, etc.
Maybe you could tell people that is where you are registered. 

"
10125,53626,"I agree with the other officiant that has answered here.  Typically the bride and groom are the ones who I deal with to make arrangements.  

Perhaps your future Mother In Law just wants to feel involved in part of the process. Maybe you could decide with your fiance an element that she could make the end decision on to help her feel involved."
10190,26876,"I would do a new thing with your bouquet and garter. I would give away the bouquet to the couple who's been married the longest, the garter to the newest married couple(other than you). There is also musical chairs, that I have seen done, and its very fun to watch grown people fight over the chair. "
10206,46258,"i discovered this site by accident. I love this site. Finding vendors through weddingwire is my favorite thing about this site."
10206,54933,"I did the same thing, and now I'm hooked on WeddingWire.  It is a one stop shop and contact network.  I love that.  Type in what you looking for from a vendor on time, and come back and get the estimate when they reply.  I love that.  I have an account over at the Knot as well, but I agree WW is definitely more user friendly. "
10197,36103,"Hello

You seem to have quite a problem here.  Why not seat 6 at a table and mingle the families together instead of letting one family sit at one table and another at a different table.  With a small sweetheart table for you and your groom."
10028,54688,"http://www.MyDreamWeddingDresses.com sells wedding dresses online at a discount of up to 80%. They also have free shipping and no sales tax. All of their dresses are between the prices of $129 to $899. There are some really gorgeous dresses for brides on a budget. There is a section that describes how to take measurements. This is at the bottom of their home page and then a section at the top that lists the measurements compared to the sizes. They also have cheap veils, tiaras etc. Hope I helped."
10177,39625,"Hi Catherine, 
It's not a must. Normally you address the invitation to the guest, and if you would like them to bring a date you would write ""Mr./Ms.name and Guest"".
Unfortunately, everyone isn't clear on the etiquette of invitations and such, so the person your inviting might still bring a guest.
Good Luck!"
10179,39625,"You may want to call the company and see what they say. It actually reminds me of Priscilla of Boston gowns, you may want to check out her website. I would call the company, see what their price is and if there's any location near you so you can try it on.
Good Luck!"
10211,39625,"Hi, 
I was just wondering if you have a picture of it. Also, if you do - you could always take it to a seamstress and let her know your budget. You may be able to own a replica!
Good Luck!"
1319,51136,"As others have already said, ""trash"" the dress is a bit misleading.  But it certainly gets your attention, doesn't it?  LOL

A few photographers I know prefer to call them ""Fearless Bridals"" because it's not about destroying the wedding dress at all.  But the brides are ready and willing to get down and dirty if need be.

I've seen some beautiful Fearless Bridal photos done in the water, etc. and I think they are just phenomenal.  But I realize these sessions aren't for everyone.  It's a personal taste sort of thing.  I happen to think they are a lot of fun, though, and agree that you can always substitute another dress for the occasion if you're worried about your wedding dress.  :)"
10206,26876,"I also discovered this site, after I got married. What I like about this site vs. theknot is the fact that you post, and communicate with others a lot easier. Theknot has forums, but you have hundreds posting and sometimes your post gets missed. Here you can be sure someone will answer. I wouldn't be able to tell you about the planning aspect, because like I said I found this site after I got married. I don't think you need to transfer all of your planning, i would just keep it there, and just use this site, to find vendors, to ask questions, and that sort of thing. Good Luck!"
10197,39625,"Hi Barbara,
what you could always do, to stand out a little more, is have you and your fiance sit at a table of your own in the center. Then have tables around you guys with your guests. This way you aren't sitting with anyone, and everyone gets to share you. 
------------------------------- O  O
------------------------------ O U O
------------------------------- O  O
You can seat 5 at a table, or remove a table and seat 6. (I assume you're not in the 30 guest count) and you and your fiance at the table (U). Ignore the (-)
Something like that. :) Hopefully, my suggestion will work or inspire you to come up with an even better one!
Good Luck!"
10190,49766,"Mz Bradley,

There are many options for entertainment such as a comedian, soloist and the three waiters (www.thethreewaiters.com) are a great form of entertainment.  Also entertain through the various parts of the wedding such as when you toss your bouquet also toss a stuff animal for the children to catch.  The adults will enjoy watching the little ones.  Instead of only allowing the best man and maid/matron of honor give toasts, allow other members of the wedding party to toast you as well.  This will make everyone feel special and I'm sure you'll enjoy the wonderful things they have to say. Another idea is to type up questions about you and your fiance (on nice cardstock set at the place setting).  At a given time during the reception ask for the cards, tally the answers, and review the questions and answers with your guests.  You can even give small gifts for the winner.  

I hope these suggestions help.  Enjoy your Big Day.
"
10028,54566,"I am also on a tight budget for my wedding in June. I have a few bits of advice...1. Your guest list is an easy way to cut the budget.  Invite on ly who your REALLY want to be there.
2.  Consider something other than Sat evening. If you move it to a morning or a weekday you can save TONS! Of course it will depend on if your guests can make it then, butu it really helped me get a fabulous place for a fraction of teh cost by having it on a Thursday night. 
3.  DIY doesn't always save you as much as you would think. Only DIY things that you know you can do and won't take a HUGE amount of time. 

Good Luck!"

Tips are always appreicated, but especially appreciated by those that are not working for their ""own companies.  In other words if you did not book your DJ through their own company, please know that they are not making what they usually do when they book their own gig.  

So, I would tip a DJ if you book through an agency.  I usually recieve anywhere from $25 to $100, but any amount is so appreciated.  Clear as mud right?  I WILL be tipping at my wedding (as long as the service was good - if it is not, no tip or a much smaller tip).  You usually can have your Best Man give out the tips with a nice hand written note of thanks."
9820,17160,"Hi!
check out the book called
The  Hand Crafted Wedding by Sarah Lugg
they have it at Barnes & Noble
its a great one for decorations "
10162,10122,"It used to be common sense that if the invite was addressed to Mr. and Mrs. and not to Mr. and Mrs. ___________ and family that children were not to be included. Sadly, however, common sense does not seem to be too common these days. I tend to agree that hopefully you can catch by their response if they plan on bringing children, and nip it in the bud before hand.

Best Wishes to you.  "
9907,11286,"Everyone has great ideas so far and I would definitely do these. It's all about what you want and like and you seem to have plenty of time to get it all ready. I would suggest the ideas you really love start putting an album together and just organize it in the order you want it done. If you write down your colors, stick it in the album. If you know what kind of flowers..put that idea in. Just pay attention to what kind you want and when they are in season! But looks like everyone so far has had wonderful ideas."
10046,38626,"Are you having Groomsmen? The groomsmen are the ushers. They should help seat guest before the ceremony."
9958,52511,"Since you are in need of so many rooms most reputable hotels in that area should be willing to offer a discount because you will be booking a block of rooms. I would recommend starting off with your brand names (Marriott, Hilton Family of Hotels, Starwood, Hyatt, etc) and then contact someone in group sales and find out what the average nightly rate will be. If there are no conventions in town and it's not peak wedding or vacation season, you should be able to negotiate, ie. contact one and then call another to see if you can get the same or better rate and so on until you find a hotel and rate that you are comfortable with. Good Luck!"
10063,56581,"If you are starting your planning now, I think you have enough time to get things in order. First things first, you should think about your budget. Come up with a number and then prioritize what is important to you and your fiance. Spend more on the important things and less on the other things; don't feel like you have to spend a bunch of money on every little thing. Since I am planning my wedding in the Bay Area as well, I can tell you that venues, food, etc. in the Easy Bay are cheaper than The City, so consider having your wedding outside of SF to save money."
10177,53299,"No you do not. My fiance and I are going to invite the people that we know have been dating for 6 months or longer. If they havent then we are not going to invite them. We are REALLY tight on the list and we just started making it a few weeks ago.

5679,56581,"I was the MOH for my best friend and she also asked another friend to be her MOH, so she had two. It took a lot of the stress off of me because we could split the duties, like I planned the shower and the other MOH planned the bachelorette party, and we could be 2 places at once! For my own wedding, I am not having any attendants, and my sister and best friend were really bummed about that, so I can see how your friend or sister might feel, but I say the more, the merrier!"
9637,46030,"I agree that you shouldn't worry about what other people think. Feel free to just be yourself!

That said, I think the word ""seafoam"" brings to mind a myriad of mental images that aren't necessarily what you intend for :) If you like seafoam, I think that going with a palette of soft greens and ivory could be really elegant and fun for the spring! You could even accent with a bold pink or a soft lavendar. Good luck with your decisions!"

Perhaps your DJ can be creative w/ his/her setup to allow for more real estate."
10230,39625,"If you do not want to go with the big traditional wedding gown - a lot of designers are making a perfect alternative. You can easily find a lovely ivory, or white gown (whatever color preference you have). A friend of mine was so against wearing a white gown to her 3rd marriage, that she bought a lovely nude gown, that had a bit of a train - so it trailed like a wedding dress.

Also if you're not going for the big traditional wedding dress, Neiman Marcus actually has beautiful gowns in their bridal section online. Something like this http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/catalog/prod.jhtml?itemId=prod45800139&parentId=cat10040735&masterId=cat10140732&index=4&cmCat=cat000000cat000001cat000111cat000131cat10040734cat10140732cat10040735
that has a little traditional look, but a modern flair.
You could also find a lovely simple gown at jcrew.com...very elegant, and not with a giant price tag, if budget is an issue.
Best of Luck!"

I just like the lay out of it and the fact that there's actually a chance of someone answering my questions.
The planning aspect of it is nice too; the checklists, budget tracker, timeline...everything :)

"
10142,55504,"I am a wedding photographer.  In my case, I don't have per-hour packages, and am with the bride and groom pretty much all day (more than any other vendor).  Since most of my clients are somewhat high-end ($5000 packages and up), I do frequently receive tips from them, ranging from $100 to $500.  With my rates, 10-15% would really be higher than I would ever expect.  

And, as one other photographer here replied, I never even ""expect"" to be tipped in money.  I agree that the best tip I can get is just a nice testimonial from you to add to my web site and your referrals in the future.  Those are priceless.  :)

I also second the comment that the other person made about the money dance.  As monotonous as they can be to photograph, they DO bring in a lot of extra money that can help pay off some of those wedding bills -- or for tipping those vendors that may expect a tip.

Congratulations on your upcoming wedding!

10124,56644,"Hi there,

I photographed a wedding about eighteen months ago where the groom and groomsmen wore hockey jerseys - and the judge wore a referee's shirt! ;)  It was great, because it added lightness to the wedding, a theme, and it helped everyone to have a bit of a sense of focus.

So, I'd encourage you to do what you want, and check in with officiants until you find one who will help you with YOUR wedding...

Good luck,

Tim!"
10158,22715,"Very abnormal. Sounds as if maybe they are a bit on the controlling side and maybe do not want to let there ""little boy"" grow up. Maybe they are just stuck up and rude, and it will take time for them to warm up to you. Is the wedding near by, or far in the future? If its far maybe they do not feel the need to discuses it as of yet, still weird, but a little understandable being they JUST met you.
Have you talked to your finance about this?What is his take?
Good luck!"
10190,22715,"Honestly as a wedding planner I must say your question has me very curious, as I have done tons of Christian weddings and I have never once heard of a no dancing rule.Please do not take me as being rude. Just trying to educate my self as this is the first I have ever heard of this. So I must ask, is the no dancing a personal thing or a religious belief ? As far as a idea for you...
You could do a slide show of the two of you as children , then growing up, ending with several pictures of you guys together. Also include pics of past loved ones etc. 
In addition, Instead of having a formal toast, possibly do a wishing hour. This is wear a microphone would be passed from guest to guest offering there best wishes for you as a newlyweds.
Best Wishes!

5605,57054,"Hi Sara,

I am also a destination wedding bride .. I learned very quickly that shopping vendors via the internet is difficult. This being my second marriage, I also learned never to take anyone's recommendation as the ""sure thing."" So, here is what I did for my upcoming wedding in barbados:

1. Conduct every possible search you can online for photoraphers at your location. You will get everything from their websites, to examples of their work, even to complaints and praises about them.

2. Use TripAdvisor - when you find a photographer that you think you may hire .. go to their forums and ask what people think. You will get local opinions.

I didn't like any of the photographers my coordinator recommended. I found one that I did like, but he was booked. I ended up finding a gentleman in Miami to fly in and do my wedding .. and shock of all shocks - it's not as expensive as you think to import one. Do the research .. you will find something that fits your vision and your budget."
10131,23505,"We are spending $1500. That includes me,groom,7 bridesmaids, 7 groomsmen, a flower girl and a ringbearer. 3 moms, 3 dads, 3 grandparents, the church and reception decor. "
10248,11213,"I agree with the others.  It's just one of those things & there's nothing you can do about it.  I thank the guys everyday that have joined the military & they are very special in my heart.  It takes a special person to join but I know it adds stress for you.  I've learned to live by ""It is what it is"".  It's not worth getting upset over.  It could be a lot worse.  I hope both of them stay safe!"
10177,11213,"We had this problem with my son's wedding.  It's hard to tell some they can bring guests & others not to.  If you are on a tight budget then it has to be.  The other problem we had is that some guests that came didn't give anything to the bride & groom just the person that was on the invite.  I thought that was odd. "
3424,57054,"Kristen,

There are a few ways to cut costs for a destination wedding, but all depend on what you are wanting. Here are some of the things we did:

- used a credit card with American Airlines and got our tickets to Barbados for ""free"" (all 3 of them). We paid the balances before interest was charged.

- transferred our remaining frequent flier miles to Hilton Advantage miles to pay for 1 night at the Hilton in Barbados

- rented a villa vice a hotel .. we are having our family stay with us (saves money on accomodations and food)

I have to disagree with the comment about hiring a local coordinator who will cut corners for you .. doubtful based on the experience we are having with ours and have read about with others. It is a good idea to hire someone local if you are planning long distance, but don't be fooled into thinking that will save you money. If you do .. be very up front about your budget and see what they can do for you.

All inclusive is a possibiility.

"
3424,57054,"Sorry for the double post =)

When you are hunting for a destination location .. think OFF SEASON. For example: the Carribean is off season during the summer. What about hurricanes, you ask .. well, there are a few islands that are rarely hit - and you can get those statistics on the internet. We chose Barbados .. one of the least likely hit islands in the chain .. wedding in the start off the off season .. and it's saving us bundles.

Ask questions about flowers: what flowers are local to the island versus what has to be imported?

Try to tailor your wedding as closely as possible with what is ""local"" to the island and perhaps not as expensive. Think simple .. let your location be the glamour."

10190,52913,"As a Christian myself, I am very respectful of your beliefs. If you don't want dancing at your wedding, why not incorporate your Christian beliefs in with your reception? 
Just a few ideas:
Have live entertainment such as praise dancers, gospel singers or choir, or even a movie/slideshow of your lives. 
Be creative and prayerful in choosing what entertainment for your reception! Its great to see that you want to stay firm on your beliefs on your wedding day, even if it involves not doing any dancing. So if your loved ones know how you live they will not be bored at your reception because they will be seeing a reflection of you!
Be blessed....

10291,56581,"While this may be a fun and entertaining game for some, you risk alienating anyone that is not in a couple or folks with casual dates (if you are inviting ""and guest""). And 10 minutes is a long time for a game like this... If you really like this type of game and want to be more inclusive, change the rules a little, like if the bottle lands on you, you have to dance or sing or something other than making out. You can have just your bridal party participate while your guests cheer them on... If you go with it, consider all the couples that might be participating, I mean, do you really want to see Grandma and Grandpa swap spit? But, I suppose it all depends on the crowd you are trying to entertain and you know them better than anyone... "

I hope I'm not stepping out of bounds here hensel2B, but this may be something that your fiance and mother should have an input in. Wouldn't want you starting off on the wrong foot by picking out a song for ""their moment.""

About the potential for others to be confused about it, like on cards or when your children go to school, it wasn't that big of a deal as a child growing up. People might assume your last name, but a gentle correction is all they need. You also have the option of changing your name legally, but still being referred to by your maiden name because no one will be checking your ID... Don't feel pressured to change your last name just so other people are not confused--you have to live with your name, not them! "

 Tom -
We are writing this letter to request a refund of 50% of the $799.00 we paid you to perform DJ services at our October 6, 2007 wedding ceremony and reception.  Needless to say there were many aspects of your services that we are very disappointed with.  
We communicated with you several times about your ability to provide microphones for our outdoor ceremony.  You agreed to provide wireless microphones for our officiant and for us.  You did not provide microphones for us.  
"
4841,57397,"Rest of letter...
The officiant microphone cut out frequently throughout the ceremony.  Not only did it appear that you hadnt sound checked this equipment prior to the ceremony, you were also noticeable absent from the ceremony, and therefore did nothing to provide a reliable back-up microphone to our officiant, even though you repeatedly assured us of your ability to provide back equipment in the case of equipment malfunction.
Many of our guests commented on their inability to hear our ceremony because of the problem with the officiant microphone, which went uncorrected, not to mention the fact that we were not miked as promised, so no one heard our vows!
You also agreed to provide a stationary microphone for the readings.  The microphone on the reading stand did not function at all.  Once again you did not appear to be monitoring your equipment or the ceremony, since you made no attempt to correct the reading microphone for the second reading.
"
4841,57397,"More of the letter...
Your inattention to us as clients continued into the evening.  We requested that you play a limited MC role by introducing us and our bridal party.  This was a rather small task, but you still incorrectly announced Meghans married name.  She is not changing her name; this was conveyed to you on the introduction sheet you had us fill out and fax to you and the schedule that was emailed to you. Instead of referring to the information provided, you assumed that Meghan was now Mrs. Klaessig.  This was misleading to our guests, and a gross lack of attention to important details on your part.
Throughout the rest of the night you were noticeably unprofessional; you were almost constantly on your personal cell phone and/or checking your cell phone messages.  Multiple times we had to get your attention or track you down to have you announce the next event, despite being provided with a schedule and assuring us that you would be the one to find us and ask about making "
4841,57397,"End of Letter...
You were completely inattentive from start to finish, much to the detriment of our wedding.  From the ceremony where you let multiple equipment malfunctions go unattended, to the reception where you were frequently conducting your personal business and not present at the DJ stand.  These actions, especially your disengaged nature during the reception, allowed the event to lose momentum and you appeared to make no attempt to keep people on the dance floor by reading the crowds preferences or engaging the crowd at all.  We do not feel that you even came close to providing the best Washington and Baltimore DJ service.  Our ceremony and reception seriously lacked in event quality and professionalism.  We saw absolutely no passion on your behalf to provide even basic quality, attention to detail, or physical presence on a very important day in our lives!"

Besides if your having it the night before, you need to remember that the more people there are the longer the night may be, especially if there is drinking. You don't what to get a few hours of rest, you want to get as much rest as possible and be ready for your big day. Remember a hangover is the last thing you need on your wedding day. Maybe your MOL has the wrong idea of what a rehersal dinner is...maybe you should talk to her or have your groom talk to her.

One  other option might be to send the little guy down the isle with some accompaniment. This 'guardian' might be able to walk three or four feet behind him, giving the impression that he is on his own.

There has to be a way around this. I have never shot under a restriction like that.

When I read your post, I started feeling a little creative.

Depending on where the rehearsal dinner is, you might have to let it go her way. Is it at your home? If not, you might want to let it slide. Lots of family and friends is ok (even if they are the in-laws, lol) and it gives you a chance to plan a daring and romantic sneak-away.

Ask if she can move the dinner up an hour or so, depending on the timing of the ceremony rehearsal.
Meet up with your friends for dinner, make the speeches, eat the food, hang for a minute, and meet your friends at a local hotspot and party....then make your daring and romantic getaway from there. 8)"

Many people who work in suits need to buy a couple at a time for the year.
So you might be able to find a deal when your wedding party purchases together.

Contact the management of the place you can find the right color and ask about a deal.
I'm young...my suits cost about 200, but in the same place they run deals like 2for175 (st. louis suit in clayton, mo). So if you have five in your wedding party.....try to work a deal.

Oh, and I have never ordered a suit that wasnt tailored before I picked it up.
Tell the wedding party to go and get their measurements and send them to you. Take that to your suit vendor. Voila. 8)"

10322,39625,"Hi AJM410,
you should actually never mention how to dress on the invitation unless it's black-tie. They will get the vibe from the formality of it, time of day/location. The other thing you can do if you're worried, is let close friends and family know about the dress code, and they can spread it around by word-of-mouth.
If you would like any suggestions on wording the invitations don't be shy to ask!
Best of Luck! "

1) Polygaphs are not the go to and end all for truthfullness. They are not even that accurate. They accuracy that the FBI claims is 90-95%, but that is false, they are only 61% accurate!! Would you really want to base your future marriage on something that is a little over half accurate? I wouldn't!!

9896,44474,"Of course, bands and DJs have had much discussions about how bad an Ipod wedding can be.  Bottom line is that it's always good to have someone in charge of the music and announcements such that they can be adapted to the moods of the event.  If cost is the main driver, I don't see how much will be saved if amplifiers, microphones, speakers, and lighting must be rented to go along with the Ipod. If cost is your concern, I suggest you work with your band or DJ to see how their services can be tailored to fit into your budget.  This does not mean picking the ""cheapest DJ"", but one who is willing to work with you within your budget or other constraints.

10316,42791,"Hi Jessy, unfortunately, I've heard of some churches having this restriction among many others. I like the idea of having an adult or even someone that's 'of age' (6) be his escort, so-to-speak. I've planned a wedding where the ring bearer was accompanied by his mother which was very classy and inspired so many awws. Another wedding had a slightly taller girl that may be 2 years older than the ring boy walk down the aisle. This was so cute. Whatever you choose, I can't see why the church would not be willing to compromise."

10315,21407,"The OP's are right. It is supposed to be for the immediate wedding party and parents. Most times, the bride and groom will also give any gifts to their wedding party during the rehearsal dinner,maybe say a few speeches  and this could make other guests uncomfortable as well as bored. Stick to your guns, and tell her that you only plan on having the wedding party at the dinner, and for the exact reasons explained before, you want it to end early enough so that everyone can be rested. Does she expect these other guests to sit in the church and watch the rehearsal prior to dinner, or meet up with you all later? They could be very bored at the church as well.  If she is paying for the dinner, this also cuts back on her costs as well.  "
10047,11774,"My husband and I married @ 11am.  We had a brunch buffet reception.  The biggest rave was the waffle station.  And it was fairly inexpensive.

10325,13173,"Photogrpahers and Videographers vary...a lot!  This has to do with the expereince and quality of their equipment.

Visit our website at www.tiratron.com to learn more about us.

One key thing I would recommend when searching for a videographer is that they use at least 2 camcorders for the ceremony.  Never hire a videographer that will use one.  What if his camera malfunctions right as you are saying your vows?  Heard a lot of horror stories so expect the best.

As for a DJ, you should expect about $200/hr, 3 hrs min.

Not to mention you'd have to either buy them all the day of the wedding or feed them all for a few days before hand, and you'd also have the problem of what to do with them.

You could try stones or shells in a vase or bowl with floating tea lights, I've seen that done before and it was really nice."
10314,56581,"I agree with the other responses that is not your battle to fight. Your FH should have 2 conversations: one with his mother about how she is being childish and about how they can resolve the conflict without it ruining your wedding; and one conversation with his father to let him know what is going on so he is not ambushed by his ex-wife at your rehearsal dinner. But because your FMIL is paying for the rehearsal dinner, she does have a reasonable expectation to influence the guest list. You may want to offer to pay for your FH's father, although this is probably not the best solution... Good luck!"

This will be my 2nd wedding--so white was out. We are having an evening wedding which will be lit almost entirely with candles. To go with the Winter color scheme, I chose various shades of blues, silvers and bright white for accessorizing. There are 4 Bridesmaids plus the Maid of Honor so two of the Bridesmaids are in a light grey (more like a ""matte silver"") with navy shashes/embellishments, and the other two Bridesmaids are opposite. This was easily done by purchasing 2 dresses in the grey & 2 in the Navy then swapping the sashes/embellishments.So in the end...I am in Navy, My Maid of Honor is in the Grey (matte silver) and the 4 Bridesmaids are in both."

I didn't want to wear white (of course) and I really didn't want a ""traditional"" gown either. With help from the Dress Boutique Owner, I chose I NAVY dress. I tought she had lost her mind when she brought it up, but I am SOOO glad she did! It is strapless with an empire waist, It gathers at the empire waist on the left side with a small rhinestone cluster. The skirt is NOT poofy...not figure hugging either, it just sort of flows and is actually very figure flattering and its floor length. It looks very elegant and tasteful.

10360,39625,"Hi Carla,
you should never word what kind of gifts you want or where your registered on an invitation. If you have a wedding website, you can put the information there. Or you can always let close friends and family know what you'll be doing, so they can pass it around by word-of-mouth. 

Remember etiquette is key, you don't want your guests to feel uncomfortable when you're too forward. Also, I'm unsure of your religious views, but in the Catholic religion they normally don't give gifts for a second marriage - so you may want to ask a close family member how it works. :)
Good Luck!
"
10355,39625,"Hi Rachel!
I'm so glad you posted. I'm going to list a few flowers you may want to go with, keep in mind whites and metallics are great for winter weddings, so you may want to go with white flowers with blue floral accents and a silver ribbon. 
White Anemone
Paperwhites - inexp.
Large Calla lilly - exp.
Tulip ""Casablanca"" inex.
Amaryllis ""Mont Blanc""
Hyacinth ""Atlantic"" ""Delft Blue"" 
Muscari (blue)
Since it's winter you may want to try a romantic bouquet, consisting of:
Fresh Herbs, ""Sterling roses"", white freesia, and sweet peas, have the stem wrapped with silver velvet. It will be warm but refreshing - it's a fragrant bouquet.
For table centerpieces you could go with mini vases filled with sprigs of thyme and rosemary with  tea lights around, inex. and simple!
Best thing to do though, is head to a florist (with or without my list) and see what they have to offer. You'll find something that catches your eye!
Good Luck :)"
10355,58009,"Thanks for responding! The ""Romantic Bouquet"" you mentioned sounds absolutely perfect. I do have an appointment with a local florist coming up, but she asked me to send her an email, if possibe, with some ideas so that she could have ""samples"" prepared for me to actually see. Yours is one I am DEFINITELY listing! Great idea for centerpieces also."
10359,54918,"Wow, it sounds like a member of your bridal party is being a real pain in the neck.  I hope things get better."
10359,26876,"I agree that your suppose to help facilitate the Both the bride and grooms dream...But I also think that the bride and groom also have to be considerate of your attendants, afterall they are their to help you too. You can't expect everyone to do to your way only, just because your getting married. And the wedding party is not JUST suppose to just help you, they are suppose to be people that are special to you in some form or way. They are volunteering their time and money to help you feel special. If they agree its because they want to be a part of your special day, and not just to be bossed around by a bride/groom. "
10088,449,"Planning your wedding is not really planning your wedding. You are being shown how the two of you solve problems together.
Brain storm all the reasons why the two of you want certain guests to a wedding. Write every reason down. Now take those reasons and put them im three groups. Now take those three reasons why you want a guest to come and apply the reasons to each guest. If the guest does not meet all three of your priority list, then cut them off the list.

10279,20427,"hmm I'm sorry I don't know of any where in the area that does kilts. But if you truly don't like the idea, perhaps you could suggest just having sashes in the family plaid. That would look good, and then you don't have to see any man legs. "
10376,20427,"2pm is the perfect time for a Dessert and Champagne (or other drink, non-alcoholic) reception. The idea of having a dinner afterwards is also nice, but after the reception, if you plan to go out with friends later, you might want to take a nap. Do not under-estimate the draining power of a wedding. I would suggest either the dinner or the partying, but not both. It's supposed to be your honeymoon, so if you miss the family dinner no one will complain. (Or at least, they really have no right to) "
10359,20427,"I agree. And I don't agree. 
Yes, it is the Bride and Grooms wedding, and thus it should be done their way. 
But as the Bride and Groom you need to think about who you are asking, and what you are asking, before you start asking. It is not the wedding parties job to stand up there and feel self-conscience because the Bride picked out a dress with no regard to the way you would feel in it. If you select a big chested woman to be in your bridal party, you need to rethink the strapless dress you want her to wear. Being a bit big chested myself, I don't feel comfortable in a strapless dress. This is something the Bride needs to consider. Either change the dress to make everyone comfortable, or rethink your bridal party. Now, if you have the perfect dress picked out, then select a wedding party thats going to look good in it. The same goes with shoes. If you have a full catholic mass, don't make your girls wear stappy shoes that hurt after 5 minutes. A little consideration FROM the Bride."

10360,20989,"I am not one who believes in following tradition just for the sake of tradition (as you can tell in all my other posts), but in this case I absolutely have to agree with Mindy. 

It's considered rude to make mention of gifts on your invitations, and even doubly so to make mention of monetary gifts.

I don't think that etiquette is key - in fact, most etiquette is a bit silly in these modern times.

However, mentioning the money tree in your invitations is basically telling your friends to give you money.  And even though it would not be your intention, it may seem rude and tacky to some guests.

Your wedding website and word-of-mouth are two tactics you have available.  Also, if you have people RSVP-ing by phone, the person taking the RSVP's could mention it as well.

Also, be prepared to graciously accept any gifts from people who didn't get the message.

Good luck on a beautiful wedding!"
10376,56581,"Why not party and hangout! If you are not taking off right after the wedding for your honeymoon (which I have been advised against doing from a few friends), maybe you could have your afternoon wedding and cake & punch reception with all of your guests and then take the limo and party it up with the right crowd. The day after, you can have a family-only going-away breakfast/brunch/lunch. This way, you have your wedding day party and still get to spend time with your family without running yourself ragged."
10325,30037,"I would have to pretty much echo what has already been said...

As a DJ I can tell you that experience is what counts... all the other BS about how much power their equipment can produce or the size of their music library is just cheap talk... 

The real issue is can they produce... or more to the point can they produce your dream...

So, price aside you need to figure out what is important to you... a big speaker system or the elegance of a well planed event."

You can also check out afloral.com they have a huge selection of silk flowers. The other thing to consider is if you want fresh cherry blossoms look to the northern states. For instance in Montana our cherry trees bloom in May...

Good luck!"
10047,8954,"Great idea! I think the idea of having different stations is a great one. Also you could have mimosas (not spelled right) for toasting. One other idea is that you could do a breakfast a tiffanys theme for your reception. You can really make it work with any color scheme.

Have a great day!
Karen"
10028,8954,"If you can choose an off day to get married you can really save. Also an early in the day wedding can also save... Choose one specialty drink to serve if you choose to serve alcohol. Another big savings is keeping the number of attendants down. You have plenty of time to shop of bargins and on line. Just remember to make a list of everything you are buying so you are not duplicating items.

Good luck!"
9663,8954,"You are on the right track when talking about candles or vases with rocks or marbles. You can make really beautiful centerpieces with tall branches in a clear vase. I would hit the dollar store or the thrift store for the vases, collect the branches yourself. You could even add some fresh flowers to the vases if you like. Also there are some really beautiful silk flowers out there you could add a few of those also!

Good luck!

Please wear what ever you like. You should enjoy your day and not worry about conventions. Most everything goes now a days! Be comfortable and do not let the fact that this is a second marriage deter you from having what you want."
5546,8954,"Nicole,

You could have a brunch reception for everyone early in the day and then plan a big night out with everyone from his family. This may be a great way to save $$$ as well. If you have an brunch reception people will not expect alcohol or even music.Perhaps you could find a resturant with a bar and music for the evening reception....."
5543,8954,"You can of course planning your wedding clothing around your theme. Another fun idea would be to set your reception up like a speak easy from the prohibition days. You could even have a special password or cryptic invite published in the local paper. Keep the glitz in mind! Also you could have a swing band beads for all of your female guests.

Good luck!

10278,18252,"Disney's Grand Floridian Beach Resort is the place for you to stay. The most romantic thing to do there, or anywhere, is a couple's massage. The Grand Floridian has a spa that offers two services for couples, the Grand Romantic Evening and the Couples Instructional Massage. For the instructional massage, they will tell you what to do and then leave the two of you alone to follow their instructions. I did this with my husband on our honeymoon aboard a cruise ship. Wow! VERY romantic. Something every couple in love should experience.

When you make your reservation, make sure the hotel knows it is your honeymoon. They will have special treats for you, like rose petals covering your bed, champagne, and chocolate covered strawberries.

Tip: Make your spa appointments well in advance - before you get to the hotel. Often the appointments are all taken if you wait until you are at the hotel. I'd call two weeks ahead to make spa appointments.

I could go on, but I've run out of room.

10272,18252,"Yes, you can have a wedding with $10,000. The average cost of an elegant, but modest wedding is $150 per person. That includes everything from your wedding dress to your transportation.

So the first task is to get a grip on the guest list. 

Next, plan a reception that does not include a full lunch or dinner. A brunch reception is nice. You can also have a 2 PM wedding ceremony and have a cake, punch, and finger food reception. If you have an evening wedding, your reception can be a champagne and dessert/cake reception.

You can make beautiful centerpieces inexpensively. Ideas are all over the Internet.

A really elegant addition to the ""cocktail hour"" is a smoke salmon presentation. It is a beautiful display. Check it out. It's not as expensive as you may think.

A nice brunch menu: scrambled eggs, applewood smoked bacon, pan-fried new potatoes, assorted bagels, Black Forest ham, biscuits and sausage gravy. You could substitute Eggs Benedict for the scrambled eggs.

Nice way to present the fresh fruit: Place a large pineapple in the middle of a round, skirted table, elevated on a box covered with white linen. Place the table where guests can go completely around it.  Stick skewers of fresh fruit the pineapple (Pineapple, strawberries, cantaloupe). Surround the base of the pineapple with additional fruit on skewers and muffins or pastries.

10396,52913,"Mrsattaway2008,
CONGRATS on your engagement! I had to do a little research on the invitations you have already purchased and I noticed they are flat invitations. This would very easy for you to add vellum sheets on top with a ribbon attached at the top of each invitation. I also found a  website that sells vellum that is right in your budget at www.crafterspaperandsupply.com . It offers vellum at different dimensions and you can take them to Kinkos or your nearest office supply or printer to have them cut according to your invitations specifications. I hope that this helps you! Also I make invitations and would be glad to offer you assistance!

Thats my opinion. I seen one with the ribbon on top and it just didnt look nice to me. But then again it all looks different. Why dont you post a pic of either one and then let people choose on here. 5 to 1 that they' ll pick the ribbon in the center. 

Good luck. I am running crazy too I am having invite nightmares too.

10408,58457,"Don't panic!  There is no need to invest in new invitations.  Do you have a wedding website?  If so you can add the new location on there as well as send out a letter to all your guests informing them of the new location and its address.  I would say something like this:

Dear friends and family:

Due to unforseen cirucmstance we have had to change the location of our reception.  The new location is ""Name of New Venue"" located at ""Address"".  

The ceremony will still take place at ""Location"" at ""Time"".

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.


You can add directions to the new location as well if it is not a location that everyone would be familiar with.

10396,58457,"Congratulations on your impending wedding!  As a professional wedding planner in Southern California, I believe less is more.  That being said, I think your invitations are very nice just the way they are and I would not add more than a wide ribbon around the middle or a thin one at the top.  If you opt for adding a ribbon at the top, I would place it just under the border of the invitation in the center.

Doing this will not detract from the invitations simple elegance yet will add that little extra something you are looking for while keeping within your budget.  Michaels, Hobby Lobby or even Wal-Mart will have ribbon that will work perfectly for your needs.

I hope this helps.

10408,26876,"I guess if your having your ceremony at a different location, you can just put the directions to the new reception in your wedding programs. You can also send like a little postcard, with the changes on there. You can buy them at like a staples or office depot, and print them out yourself. And, if you have a wedding website, like mentioned before, you can put it there as well. Just, breath and try not to stress too much. I think also if worse comes to worse(hopefully not) just have your people help in making phone calls if possible. Things like this can happen, and I don't think your guest are going to think anything wrong with you calling them to let them know the changes. "

As far as where to find your second dress, don't limit yourself to ""bridal"" gowns. Look at any major department store, and since prom season is also coming up right before your wedding, you can probably find a beautiful evening dress that will be a breeze to dance in. Also consider a white or ivory ""bridesmaid"" dress. Either of these options will save you money and you'll still be a beautiful bride."

I had a calm chat with the future MIL last night and she still kept saying that they need more! I told her (very nicely) that my daughter should not have to give up any of her invites. I was then told that since the future FIL is very active in their church he is ""expected"" to extend an open invitation to the ENTIRE church!

10408,39625,"Hi pauleasegirl,
well as mentioned below, if you have a wedding website that could work, but not everyone visits those all the time especially elder guests. What you may want to do (since I was in the same situation) is head to your local printer/stationary store. And what they could do is print on a smaller card (in whatever color) the new information. 
Like:
Hall name
Location
Time
You just have to mail them out, and if anyones confused they'll give you or parents a call.
The store will know the proper format. It cost me about $100, but that was also because I chose crane & co. paper and needed 50, usually the store has their own brand in a variety of colors, where small sheets are 10cents.
Best of Luck!"

You may want to try Neiman Marcus, JCrew, Saks. And look in the sale/clearance online - you may just find exactly what you want!

10360,14896,"Hi there Carla,
I must agree with the other posts.  I typically encourage my clients to break tradition if they want a little something different; however, I feel quite comfortable in saying that you may offend your guests when you ask for money on your invitation.  Because you are asking in the first place, I am sure that running the risk of offending your guests is definitely not your intention.

Make sure that your close family members and your close friends know that you prefer monetary gifts -- Then they can share your preference when they receive inquiries from guests. 

Best wishes on a fabulous wedding!

Love & Soul Always, Kay"
10028,14896,"Here are some recommendations:

1. Large wedding party <-- Keep it small
2. Alcohol <-- Consider offering a signature drink instead of a full bar.
3. Peak Wedding Season
4. Out of Season Flowers <-- Talk to a local florists or floral wholesaler about flowers that are in season in your region.  And use those.  I believe that someone else recommended using filler flowers.  That is a great recommendation.

I highly recommend THE DIY Bride book.  There are a ton of beautiful details that you can add to your wedding for a fraction if you do it yourself.

Another craft idea is putting together your wedding album yourself.  There are a lot of companies (i.e., www.blurb.com) that can help you create a fabulous album for a fraction of the cost.  If you do this, take your time.  You will not have the trained eye that the photographer has, but you will know what it important to you and your groom!

Best wishes on a fabulous day!

Love & Soul Always, Kay"

10419,27142,"I got married in October and I used burgundy, cream/ivory, yellow and pastel pink. My mom wore a light green dress, my mother-in-law wore gold and my grandmothers wore pink and silver. It was a great mix. "
10360,27142,"Simply put, I think it's really rude to ask for money (or anything else) for your wedding. Check any bridal magazine and they'll tell you. Yes, gifts are generally expected, but mentioning money or any other kind of gift (i.e. a registry) is rude and if I received and invitation with that on there, I'd be offended. If people ask you what you'd like (as many people did to me), then tell them, but don't put it on your invitation. Tell your closest friends and family and have them spread the word on your behalf."
10046,27142,"I had both ushers and groomsmen, as the ushers escorted the grandmothers. We had 2 ushers and they handed out programs and yarmulkes (we're Jewish), while telling guests to seat themselves. We reserved the first 2 rows on each side for family (we put names on the backs of the seats). Having different sides doesn't work when one side would be larger and also, if you have mutual friends. As luck would have it, some of my extended family and his extended family actually knew each other (we didn't know this at the time!) and sat together!"
10028,27142,"Here's what we did:

1. Afternoon wedding--Saturday night weddings are typically the most expensive.
2. Our centerpieces were shallow bowls with rose pedals. They were beautiful and much less expensive. Besides, people move the tall centerpieces anyway as they can't see other people at their table!
3. Have the ceremony and reception at the same place. Your guests will appreciate this!
4. Don't have a champagne toast. Every wedding I've been to, this is a waste. Many people don't drink champagne. The glasses are filled and it gets dumped out when nobody drinks it. Nobody says you can't use wine for a toast. Simply have the guests that want a glass go to the bar and get one (have the DJ announce this) and everyone else can do it with soda or water. Trust me; nobody cares!
5. Use a DJ instead of a band. Not only is it cheaper, but you get more variety of music.
6. Have your bridal party use their bouquets as decorations after the ceremony.
Good Luck!"

Most of the time, the over the phone, word of mouth is enough to let people know where you're registered.  Also....many people who've attended weddings in the past, will automatically (especially the women of the families)...check with Macy's, Target,etc....

In other words, both of you, register where you desire,and most people will check when shopping for you.

Just a thought.   Spend one or two days. Get up early...have a fantastic breakfast. Then....go to some antique stores, and of course,
local ""vintage"" clothing or ""Ragtime"" type stores,which should easily have your period decors.  Call them ahead of time, and ask how much of that period is currently in their store.

Its a super good book and its realistic about cutting corners with out cutting your self too deep. One of the main themes they kept repeating is cutting down the guest list. You can have a 200 large party with bare of wedding stuff or 50 people with a lot of wedding stuff.

If you go to borders or on amazon they have the same book but its how to have a wedding under $5,000. 

On the hotel issue I would look at near by hotels and their rates. Sometimes motel 6 costs more than a 4/5 star hotel.

10360,50366,"I agree that you should have close friends and family know your preference and be able to know when your guests ask them.  

It is also good to let them know (if you know yourself) what you will be doing with the money (i.e., spending money for the honeymoon, a new deck for the house, new furniture, etc.) that way they can feel like they are giving to a ""cause"" not just ""mad"" money.  I, as a guest would love to know that I am helping to furnish your new love nest!  

I have passed the word along to our friends and family that we would prefer home depot gift cards to do some much needed projects in our new ""fixer upper"" home.  So, next time they are sipping margaritas on our new deck they will know that it was built through their contributions....the circle of love!"
10475,39625,"Hi,
it's not rude at all. And with weddings becoming more and more extravagant and expensive it's not always in the budget to entertain everyone.
What you would do, is send it the week you get married (or after). You could always get a picture of you and him at the wedding, and have a date printed. It's just to let friends/family know you're married, and your anniversary.
Best of Luck!

Good Luck with everything, im sure it will all work out, after all, you can sleep the rest of your life right, haha...:) Have a great wedding, and congrats! "
10460,26153,"I'd say if you are really close with both, than go ahead and have both. Otherwise if you are just thinkin of have your fiance's sister, cuz it's his sister, u might want to consider just having her as a bridesmaid. She is not going to be offended if you two are not super close. I def. wouldnt have her over your sister though, i'd either do both, or just your sister. "

10508,39625,"I think it's a fabulous idea! I love breakfast also, but I pushed my reception a little later and made it brunch. 
You could always head to the Justice of Peace and get married there just the two of you. Or you can bring parents and siblings as witnesses. The court house doesn't mind at all.  Send out cards saying you eloped and that they are invited to a 
Meet Mr. & Mrs. Name 
Breakfast Reception on Date, Time, and Location.

I think you have an absolutely great idea!
Best of luck!"
10408,58099,"No need to worry. 

The website is always a good idea, but as mentioned already, only about 1/2 of the people will be able or willing to check it. However, it is free, so why not?

A post card is a great way to inform guest of updates. Depending on how your original invites were created, you should be able to get, make or have made a simple post card with new info. It is also a great way to remind your lazy guests to RSVP. For 26 cents, you can mail a postcard. So depending on the paper and guest count, you should be able to get it easily taken care of for well under 100 bucks.

Have fun with it. Turn it into something fun. Say that the old reception hall couldn't handle the amount of fun you were planning, so you had  to change venues.

Also, probably 25% or so of your guests are very close friends, call them, have family mention it. Word of mouth travels fast and it's free.

10248,49101,"I think the important part is that he shares in your special day.  Although he might miss some of the pre-partying, your fiance has chosen him specially to be his best man, and must have a strong connection with him.  Unless he makes the decision to bow out, I dont see any problem with only having him there on your big day.  "
10360,58099,"Don't register anywhere. Yeah, you will always get a couple candle holders you will immediately throw out, but for the most part, people will give money when there is no other option. 

You really can't be mad at anyone that buys you a plate with a prayer from another religion, or from that uncle that give 10 bucks no matter what the occasion. 

Personally, I wouldn't mention the desire for money. I also think you should know the people coming to your wedding, so if you can get away with it, make it fun as mentioned previously.

-botter"
10420,58099,"I would say start with colors you would normally think of. Deep reds, orange, yellow, browns and so on. Then forget about them. You are getting married IN October, not TO October. Unless you really love the fall and the colors associated with it, don't feel obligated to follow the crowd. Thousands of other brides will have garnet and orange and brown and sage green. 

If you do love the Fall, start with those colors and push them further to create some interest. I think nothing says fall like eggplant. Take a deep eggplant and mix it with some classic. Maybe a silver or ivory. Maybe some detail of orange or red. Red and purple love each other. 

Another idea would be to push any greens to the lime side. If your colors look a little on the summer side, your guests will be delighted with the memory of warm days.

-botter
"
10104,58099,"Navy and silver is nice.

It really depends on your style and personality. You want guests to open your invitation and say... ""this is so YOUR NAME HERE"". So if you are fun and outgoing, don't be afraid to add in some fun color into that mix. A nice bright green, ice blue, tiffany blue, even pink or coral. If you are very reserved, stick with blue and silver. Maybe add in some white, or different shades of blue of silver. Dark grey, silver and navy blue would be delish!

Autumn begins march 1st, so it's perfect because a collection of browns and jewel tones work well.
For centerpieces you could do something heavy and warm like hurricanes, with candles, and jewels filling the hurricanes slightly.

10510,56581,"First things first, ASK YOUR VENUE!!! I have known on-site wedding coordination to include set-up and break-down or furniture/coordination of staff, making sure the bride, groom, and bridal party are taken care, running the flow of the event, and even serving as the MC, so double check what you are getting yourself into. Every place that offers this service may include different things, so go straight to the source to confirm what the usually offer. You may be able to request additional services, maybe for a nominal fee or possibly free, but there is no harm in asking."
10537,20427,"Sure! They can walk together and be adorable without a ring bearer! There is nothing wrong with that at all! "
10537,56581,"It is your wedding, so do want you want!!! Two flower girls will be lovely and most people won't even notice that you didn't have a ring bearer... and if they do, they won't care. Most of the time, the ring bearer doesn't even hold the rings (would you really trust a child with an expensive piece of jewelry?), so you're not missing out on anything. If you want to have the flower girls carry the rings instead of a traditional ring bearer, you can always have the rings in a box at the bottom of the flower baskets/holder one of them is carrying."
10460,56581,"I was the MOH for my best friend along with another one of her friends, and I really loved having a partner in crime, so to speak.  It made it a tons less stressful on me because I could split the responsibilities with someone else. I hosted the bridal shower and the other MOH planned the bachelorette party, and we had each other to use for support whenever we needed. Consider yourself fortunate to have more than one person that you want to be your MOH!"
10504,44474,"Erin,

Select a DJ with whom you can easily communicate.  Your guests will remember the entertainment and whether they had a good time at your wedding for many years.  Your ideal DJ will provide MC and entertainment services that fit your vision of the atmosphere of your reception.  This is achieved through extensive planning and discussion concerning entertainment options.

10248,18635,"I agree with the other posts.  You really can't let it get to you.  My sister, who is a bridesmaid, goes into the police academy 2 weeks before my wedding.  She'll make it in town the night before my wedding.  I have to accept it and move on.  This is what's best for her future.  The same applies to the best man.  He has to look at his FUTURE vs pre wedding events.  Future def. takes priority.  "

10537,26876,"I had two flower girls. So, yes and remember its your wedding you do what you want."
10508,26876,"I think that should be fine, just remember that you'll still be the center of attention though, so I would let you fiance know that. Another idea is just incase YOU wanted to have a ceremony type of thing, is incorporate it to your reception. Like you can have all your guest sitting at their tables, and just have a Justice of the Peace do the civil ceremony there, it would very short maybe 10mins tops, and that way your guest can say they were there to witness it and not really feel like you are the center of attention. I saw something similar to this in Reality show, it seemed very intimate."
10537,60300,"This is modern times and alot of the old rules/guidelines are out the door. 

Simply put: This is your wedding you set up the way your heart desires.

If you wanted a ring bearer with out a flower girl.. or if you didnt want either, better yet I had a wedding that had ""4 of each"" and no it was not a double wedding...

Anything goes!
Dream it and create it!!"
10419,60300,"There are so many ideas you can use...Do not limit yourself to the just the colors you choose.

Let your mind go wild, and express!  But remember stay with-in your budget!"

Congratulations."
10510,60300,"Make sure you have everything in writting from everyone. Make sure all details down to the dust on the floor is included.  Every event and coordinator is different and has different views on how things are to be done.. 

If you want less stress a coordinator is the best way to go and you can hire them on an hourly basis, partical or full service basis.. That is thier job is to make yours easy.. to just relax!!!

As someone mentioned earlier...ASK ASK ASK...and Confirm!!!"
10489,60300,"I like what Mindy had mentioned... she has great ideas!  
Take a look around the web, catalogs.. see what colors strike you...
As I have said before in another posting.. Times are changing. Which means not all rules apply.

Take a step into a bridal store what colors do you see? I was just in one yesterday with one of my brides and the colors are BRIGHT, and festive!!  

I always say the wedding is about the bride and groom..Do as you please (stay within budget) the reception is about entertaining your guests... 

Those are my two cents worth... "

10510,1616,"There is a difference between a planner and a coordinator. Most likely, the coordinator and the catering staff will do all of those things that you mentioned above, but they will not do any of the pre-event planning, like helping you stay within your budget, find dresses, and coordinate your hired wedding professionals. If your ceremony is not at the same venue, they won't help with any of those details either. 

As someone mentioned earlier, contact the venue to ask exactly what the coordinator will and will not do. "
10504,1616,"Meet with the DJs so you can make a decision based on their styles and personalities. Ask if they have video footage of their performances at recent weddings so you can see what you will be getting. "
10489,1616,"Considering that it will probably be cold and/or snowy, I suggest planning as a winter wedding. Jewel tones would look great."
10537,20989,"To affirm what everyone else said - yes of course you can have two flower girls and no ring bearer.  But it seems to me that you wouldn't ask the question if you didn't like it for some reason.  If that is the case, you could have the one girl be a flower girl and the other girl be your ring bearer.  It's your wedding and you can do whatever your heart desires, so the ring bearer doesn't have to be a boy!

Good luck with whatever you do!  It will be a beautiful wedding if you follow your heart, no matter what you decide."
10460,20989,"No matter what you decide, make sure your photographer knows you're very close to both of them.  You can take portraits with just the two of them, to let them know you love them both and are close to both of them.  I don't have a sister, but when I got married I made sure to have my photographer take portraits of me with just my two sisters-in-law (my brother's wife and my husband's sister).  It made them both feel special.

Good luck with your choice!"

10582,60300,"Since your in Phoenix, I know 2 possible answers to your question.

Yes, you can higher a day coordinator which will make sure vendors have everything in line and ready for you.

You can also contact a company that I know of azpartydesigns.com and they will do the decorating for your...it is one step less then a coordinator, and possibly less expensive.

Good Luck

10568,60300,"This is your wedding, you can implement anything you desire.

The previous poster had a good point reading a poem or a speak is very good.  

She also may walk down the isle as if in bridal party and when reaching the alter, she may sit with your parents, this will accomplish 2 factors..you have her participating in the wedding and as well as her feeling she is apart.  She will may be delighted with the idea..This maybe an event you both will remember..She will!

Also the other idea is have her be the guest book attentant.. She is still participating as well has a great responsiblity to make sure everyone signs in.. (I got married 2 years ago and we didn't have on, my husband didnt feel as if we needed one. Off 75 guests we only recieced 12 that signed)

Everyone feels they are taking a part of your reception. ALso honored you have asked them.. WIN, WIN!

 As a previous poster put ""contact them"" If he can not be the ""ring bearer"" They may allow for him to just walk down and then go sit... 

No responsiblity on his end.. Some churhes are concerned with old customs, if the ring is dropped, also if the child will act out or not. 

You even may ask him to do something ""even more special"" during the reception..."
10315,60300,"In wedding planning I have learned there are 10 commandments of proper etiquette. 

What does your groom say?  The ultimate choice comes down to the both of you.

She may be paying for the reception, she does have to listen to the both of you.

I was coordinating a wedding and a similar situation arose.  I suggested for the groom to go to his parents have a one on one conversation with them expressing the desire of a smaller reception.  Then as a back up, he told his mother that she would have to bring her side of invites down. (his idea) but it ended up working.. 
The grooms mother heard her sons voice and honored it.

I can not say this will work here, it is always worth a try..if your groom is on the same page as you.."

10316,45992,"Hi Jessy,

If you are not able to work something out with the church, having him walk down the aisle after the ceremony for the pictures is something you can have staged. Your videographer and photographer will be able to help you. Don't forget that he can be in all the other pictures as well.

As the other vendor mentioned have someone walk him down. We've seen many renditions of small children participating, one being pulled in a cart or escorted by a slightly older child.

Best of luck!

10582,11289,"Hi!
have you spoken with your venue about this? Many times a venue has encountered this dilemma before and may have a member of the church or a friend of the facility they can recommend who would be glad to help out!
Be well organized so when you get responses it's easy to communicate just what you want. For example, draping tulle, assembling and setting up the pew bows, setting out the guest book table, programs and laying a runner.
IMHO there is not all that much that needs to be done for the ceremony set up (church?), you should be able to get someone for two hours and be done with it!
Of course a DOC would be the easiest answer!
Happy Planning!
Good luck!"
10600,11289,"Hi there!
Since I am a business I have a machine that is more costly than what you'd want to invest in...however! My suggestion is to purchase a laser printer. 
Ink jet printers will give you a product where the ink may rub off and run in worst case senarios.
I have loved every HP printer I have ever owned and highly suggest a laser jet printer from HP, you can find one for under $200 and you'll be so happy if you want professional quality you can produce at home.
Happy Planning!"
10568,11289,"I agree with the answers from Randi and Tammany!
How about having her be included as a candle lighter? Will you be having candles on the altar for a unity candle or candelabras at your ceremony?
The idea would go like this; 
She can walk down the aisle before or after (I suggest after) the seating f the mothers/family. She would walk up and light the two candles that represent you two that you light the unity candle with. She can take the flame from the already lit 'lights of Christ' candles many churches have on the altar. She can also walk in with a lit candle and light those two candles, or light the candelabras if you are having them! Church facilities should have torches to light candles with, otherwise use a taper with a drip catcher.
You could also have her hold your bouquet during the ceremony. Hand your bouquet off to her  as you pass her (have her in the first row/pew), then she can hand it back to you after! 
Add a spacial note and thank you to her in your program!

It will be great for the wedding - just not so much for every day.  The first thing I do post-honeymoon will surely be to have it cut short again!"
10621,57386,"It's funny you should say tis because I had a similar problem. What I would like to know is when your Wedding is? 

Personally I scrapped the barrel looking for the girls stand up in my wedding coming up in July. I started coming up with ideas just after my proposal over laborday weekend and came to the conclusion I had all of two people I would like to ask aside from my twelve year old daughter. 

However, My Fiancee had no joke like 8 guys lined up. I finally talked him into only doing very close fam and friends so I kept my three and he used family members. 

As months have gone by, things have changed. It just sort of does, I have noticd (even though this is my second wedding) weddings are full of a lot of drama. So now my small wedding party has turned into quite a big one. I ended up asking my finaces sisters to stand up as well so my three turned in to five and then old friends came out of no where and now I have 8."
10359,14789,"Bridal party members should feel blessed to have been asked. Bridal party members do what is needed and allow the bride and groom to enjoy their planning and their day. As much as the wedding planning should not be stressful, often times it is. A bridal party member needs to be supportive no matter what, even if you feel the bride and groom are wrong. 

If a bride likes a particular dress, color and style for her vision of her wedding day then so be it. This is minor if you have a sad and disappointed bride. 

I knew one bride who was left alone on the night before her wedding day. Her Matron of Honor (a substitute mom, for her real mom was deceased) was selfish and left her alone instead of making that night special. This was a time for this bride to feel wonderful! Instead she cried on the phone to her groom-to-be and could not wait for the next day because it was their day!

So, is the dress, the shoes and any other material item really that important?  "
10489,55070,"Many of the brides that have purchased their wedding favors from us for their March weddings, have focused on tiffany blue and white or tiffany blue and brown -- these colors are beautiful and work well for any time of year.  We carry many aqua blue/tiffany blue favors

Actually over the past 24hrs my in-laws have become ultra-creative in heir ideas and thoughts.... which is what I was hoping to have in an exchange here:  Stories and experiences, especially from those familiar with Oak Island and Southport.  In brief, I'm not looking for a planner at this time, but instead people that want to share stories :-)  "
10571,36654,"Many weddings have the dog as the ring bearer...also, outdoor locations are obviously very conducive to having dogs.  Maybe, have a friend or maybe a young guest (10-12 year old) be in charge of the dogs."
10644,47925,"Cherisse,

Asking someone to be apart of your special day is a big responsiblity.  Some brides are close with the ladies and gents that they wish to have in their bridal party and can just ask them face to face.  Some like to do a small invitation inviting them to apart of the Bridal Party.  It all depends on your particular style.  By all means I believe that face to face is the way to go.  Good luck!"
10618,47925,"Connie,

Of course we know that your mom wants only the best for you and she doesn't want your special day to be ruined by an uneven bridal party but she must also realize that although she is paying for the wedding, the wedding is yours - not hers. Tradition states that everything be even, it's just the nature of order in this world we live in.  However, a suggestion may be to ask 2 of your bridesmaid to be hostesses which would keep them in the bridal party.  I would hope that they would understand that you want to keep it even and that being a hostess is just as important.  But if not, you can always have each person walk down the aisle by themselves, such as bridesmaid, groomsmen, bridesmaid, pause, bridesmaid, groomsmen, bridesmaid giving the appearance that the groomsmen is escorting both ladies.  Ultimately the decision is yours, not your mom's.  Good luck!"
10568,47925,"Depending on how close you are with your sister you may opt to have her as your Maid of Honor.  Yes this position normally holds/pulls everything together and has many responsibilities but I have seen it work beautifully.  My best friend decided to have her daughter as her Maid of Honor and all the Bridesmaid helped the daughter out when it came time to plan the Bridal Shower.  Of course the daughter could not plan the Bachlorette Party but she was included in the Spa Day part of it.

This is a trend that many brides and grooms are taking on.  Another client of mine has a 6 year old brother.  He decided that he wanted his little brother as his Best Man...everyone in the wedding party understood and did what needed to be done to help the little brother out.  So it can be done.  Just another option for you.

Congratulations and Good Luck!"
10621,45992,"Hi Mel_Az,

For my wedding I chose married couples. Husbands and wives who were friend's to the both of us. The longest married maid was my MOH and each maid walked down the aisle with their spouse. I had them photographed with their spouses, framed the image and gave them as gifts.

Just an Idea.

Best Wishes

10420,45992,"If your groom has a favorite color it might be nice to ask him what colors he likes. aht then add to what he suggests. 

Black and white never fails make a good color for brides dresses and they can use them over again...if they are not too formal. We have had many brides get married in October. One bride chose autum colors, another chose deep purple and emerald green, and another chose brown and white. 

If you every need to see some of those colors in action your can email me and I can send you some samples.

10644,8287,"Hello Cherisse, I would assume the reason behind your asking these ladies to be a part of your wedding is because you feel close to them and share a friend intimacy.  I think based on that it would be nice and more personable to as them by phone or in person.  It will make them feel honored and it will give you first hand response to their reaction to being in the wedding."

Please make sure you are clear because you will need someone to confirm with your vendors before the event, make final payments, oversee setup and be there to handle any last minute mishaps that you do not want to be worrying over on your wedding day.  If you don't opt to hire a planner make sure you get a close friend that is not in your wedding party as they will need to be at the ceremony site early and stay late to take photos.

Sure, the day is primarily for the couple, but it's not all about you. A wedding is a celebration for your friends and family. Being self-centered just takes the fun out of it. Like others have said, it's your job to be considerate of the people in your wedding party. 

Of course, if someone is truly being a pain, you should consider asking them to step down or do something else. There's wayyyyy too much going on in a wedding to deal with a primadonna."
10652,58099,"Hello.

It depends on how you are wording the rest of the RSVP. If you are offering the choice of entree, you could try this:

M_________________________________
___ Number Attending
___ Chicken  ___ Fish  ___ Veg  ___ Under 12

___ Regret


If you are not offering the choice:

M_________________________________
___ Number Attending
___ Adults  ___ Under 12

___ Regret

Obviously you would word the ""Number attending"" and ""Regrets"" in the tone and style of your wedding, but I would say putting ""Under 12"" is a good way to word it. If you offer ""children"" or ""kids"" as an option, you will have moms marking their 18 year olds as ""kids"".

Be as descriptive as you can with the wording. You will see countless ways of marking ""will attend"". You may be expecting numbers, but will surely see Xs, Os, smileys, or any number of other markings.

10618,50479,"You really need to explain the concept of the bridal party to your mom. These are supposed to be people that you're close to and want to recognize as special, not warm bodies filling a quota! It's just not fair to ask your FH to create ""filler"" people. And really, it's a little close to your wedding date to be bringing in new people to the bridal party.

Could you use the junior bridesmaids as flower girls instead? Or even ring bearers, if you haven't chosen already. And are all of the bridesmaids specifically close to you-that is, could one or two of them stand on the groom's side instead? You don't have to be divided up by sexes.

Of course, if you absolutely must, you can ask some of your bridesmaids to step down. Explain the situation with your mom, and hopefully they'll understand!"
10396,4007,"Have you considered adding a graphic element (either printed or stamped and embossed?) Or you could add a seal on the invitation itself or the inner envelope.

Sprinkle it with the embossing powder color of your choice. let it set a few seconds  (so the color melts in) then stamp with the sealing wax seal of your choice. WHen cool and dry, you and use a super tacky tape (the kind with the red backing on a roll) or a heavy duty glue to affix the seal to the paper.

You mention that you are a young bride, so I am going to assume that texting and e-mail are part of your daily life.  But, with a wedding you should really go old-school and ask them face to face.  If you have an out-of-town person to be in the wedding party, use a personal invitiation, preferably something hand-written.  There are a lot of very fun, unique ways to ask your bridal party.  The last wedding that I was in, the bride purchased ""bridesmaid"" t-shirts for all of us and gave them to us at a girls night out gathering.  Very cute!"
10618,61177,"Connie,
Ultimately it should be your and your fiance's decision as to how you want to handle this, but we all know what it's like to have a difficult mother.  You should stress to her that times have changed and that there are no rules as to how many attendants you need or if there needs to be an even amount.  Most church weddings don't even have the groomsmen walk down the aisle, but instead are up front with the groom.  So you could just have your 2 groomsmen escort 2 bridesmaids each for the recessional.  Your mother should never be allowed to choose your fiance's groomsmen, nor should you ever rescind an offer to one of your friends to be a bridesmaid.  If she's worried about etiquette, this would be horribly rude and inappropriate."
10644,56581,"Having been a bridesmaid 3 times, I would suggest calling anyone out of town and a face-to-face conversation with anyone in town. The first wedding I was in, I wasn't even asked, she just assumed I would do it and starting making plans for me. That was totally heinous and I assume you won't do that... The second time, I was asked face-to-face, and it was a real honor to be her MOH. The last time, I was asked to be a bridesmaid via text, and although we do communicate a lot via text, it still felt weird and impersonal. A simple visit or call is all you need although they do make ""be my bridesmaid"" invitations these days."

10652,49399,"Are you requiring that all children under 12 only have the chicken fingers option?  I would caution that unless you can negotiate more under 12 options, you may have some issues.  Just as adults have a few choices, so should the children or you may have some unhappy guests.  Some ideas to ask for as an option are macaroni and cheese, burgers, pizza, or a smaller portion of what is served to the adult guests.  

Just a suggestion."
10621,59140,"If you feel that you must have one, then think about who has been the closest to you and most supportive through the time you've know them?  Also, see which one can you depend on the most and which one has the best leadership skills.  Which one has been most supportive since you starting your planning and is genuinely happy for you. 

If there are two people that fit that description, then so be it.  There is no written rule that says you can can't have two. If you feel that they are equally supportive then don't select just one.

Going to the expos can be a little overwhelming for some people.  Seeking the advice of a professional may help narrow down your running around and help you alleviate the confusion.  Some consultants offer ""consultations only"" which doesn't require you to enter into a contract with them.  There is usually a small consultation fee charged for the professionals' time but the information received is well worth it. 

A word of advice - just because you see a vendor advertised in a lot of locations doesn't make them better, it just means they have a good advertising budget.  You need to be an educated consumer when choosing your vendors.   

Best of Luck to you. "

If you don't have planner working with you, ask your reception venue to order samples of the linen and napkins so you can actually see how they look together.

I know personally  as a mother, if my son was to announce he was getting married and I had never met the young lady, it would make me feel some sort of way but I still would be welcoming to her and not be rude.  If he feels like you do, then ask him to talk to his family to get an idea of why they reacted that way.  There may be some underlying drama there that you don't want to tap into.

Although you got in engaged in October of 2007, it's not too late to announce it and host an engagement party.  I recommend doing it this spring/summer if you can.

9919,59140,"Inna, I am glad that you sought to ask this question.  I am a planner but when I was a Bride too had a planner.  The cost depends on the service tier you choose with the planner.  Some offer day of service, full service, partial planning, etc. When you meet with planners, I would suggest you have a list of questions to ask them and ask for referrals/references.  You want to ask questions such as how many weddings they do a year, do they a team/staff that works with them, are they insured, how many years have they in the industry, are they part-time or full time.  Also, see who makes you feel most comfortable.  I believe that you should vibe with your planner and feel like you can trust them with your special day.

10736,18635,"My fiancee and I have both been on Carnival at differnet times.  We both enjoyed it.  Some of the downfalls if you care about these things...you handle your own luggage.  Whatever airport you fly into, you claim your luggage, you get to port you have to again deal with your luggage.  It's then left outside your cabin.  When leaving you place it outside your cabin the night before, you then have to go into a huge warehouse to locate your luggage, then take it to the shutte that transports you to the airport and so on.  This annoyed me.  Food was okay, could have been better.  Lots of children and families.  Whenever I went to the main pool it was loaded with children.  The hot tubs same thing.

10734,58457,"Hi Wowgirl:

By catering do you mean he is actually cooking the food as well?  That seems like such an undertaking for the father of the bride on her wedding day.

Anyway, while he is paying for the food it is your wedding and you should have a say in what is served so long as it is within his budget.  That being said, if he can only afford to feed 75 you either need to cut your guest list or pay for the additional guests.  

Although it is true that he wouldn't have to purchase 150 pieces of each item to feed all 150 guests, it would still double his original budget to a number that he may not be comfortable with.  Therefore, you need to sit down with him and talk about the menu as well as the guest list and let him know you are willing to pay for part of the food in order to keep you guest list the way you want it and to serve the type of meal you want.

I hope this helps.  Should you have any additional questions, feel free to contact me directly at wendy@laocweddings.com
"
10652,58457,"I have to agree with Holly.  I would just list the option as ""under 12"" and leave it at that.  Guests get confused enough when you give them choices as it is because envitably there will be those guests that forget what they ordered.  Don't stress yourself further by giving the kids a choice as well.  I say this, not to be mean, but because I have seen first hand the havoc it can cause.  A child said they want chicken fingers but then the child sitting next to them has mac n cheese and suddenly that looks better than what they have and now they want mac n cheese.  See where this is going?  

Keep it simple.  You will be glad you did.

I hope this helps.

10206,31333,"this one just seems more intimate than the knot.  i found this site through an ad on facebook and barely visit the knot anymore.  luckily i didn't have very much done on that one lol so it'll be easy for me to move instead going from one site to another because i have my info spread all over the place."
10748,26876,"I am going to be very honest with you. I got married after I got my BA, about two months later. Right now I am working on my Masters and working too. At first we thought that we would be ok with my going back to school for my Masters and him taking care of the bills. My husband makes very good money and could pontentially carry the load by himself, but it makes it so much harder when you have to ask your husband for some money. Thats why I work part-time, because I feel very uncomfortable with him paying for everything, even my School. I guess what I am trying to say is that I recommend that you finish school, it will make a difference, trust me I know. And I would do some research about pell grant, they may not give you a lot if your married. I know that you just want to get married, but you have to also take into consideration the burden it would be for your fiance to carry. Remember its not always about the money, consider the stress of school, its different from work. Good Luck!"
10701,61839,"I have a very different opinion for you.  I have been on four Carnival cruises in the last two years, and I absolutely love them!  I am 25 with no kids, and I still have a blast on Carnival's ships, contrary to what the other person said.  In fact, my fiance and I are taking a Carnival cruise to the Caribbean for our honeymoon this June.  Carnival's prices are much more reasonable than the other cruise lines, service is great, they really work to make sure that you have a good time, and there is always something for everyone.  If you are in the mood to relax and be left alone, then you will get that.  If you are in the mood to explore the ship and find fun things to do at all hours, then you will get that too.  Or, if you are in the mood to book amazing shore excursions in the port cities, then you will find wonderful choices there.  Yes, there are kids on board, as there are on just about any cruise ship; however, it really isn't a big nuisance.  I highly recommend Carnival cruises!"
10751,61839,"My maid of honor will be carrying a bouquet that is slightly different than the bridesmaids' bouquets.  Hers will look a little more like mine and also be bigger than the others.  That is one idea."
9637,61864,"i love shades of green and saw some light green favor boxes that are so pretty -- i'm thinking about using them for my wedding next year also:

10758,57865,"I would definitely suggest the white, pink or red roses. You could also do a combination. Maybe one of each color if it will fit. Also you may be able to put some floating candles in there if you can find some that are small enough."
10759,61939,"I would pick colors that looks best on your girls or even possibly your favorite colors. Also try to think of the date, since yours is in April than I would have done like pinks, or light blues or yellows. You know Spring colors. That's how I did it! Thanks for the response on mine as well :)"
10621,55189,"Choosing attendants is never easy. Especially when the possiblity of someone's feelings gets involved. The most important consideration is choosing the person who is closest to you. If you have two best friends, such as I did...then you can choose both. Times have changed so rules aren't as traditional as they used to be. Only one maid or matron of honor and one groomsman need to serve as the official witness when papers are signed, the other duties can be shared. Step 1:
Consider the role of the maid of honor. She is someone who will be by your side throughout the wedding and who will help you with planning and anything else that you might need. 

Step 2:
Consider the popular choices for maid of honor: your sister, your fiance's sister or a close friend. 

Step 3:
Think about what you want in your maid of honor and talk it over with your fiance. 

Step 4:
Keep in mind that it is your wedding and, though a friend might be hurt at first by not being chosen to be your maid of honor, your friends and family will understand and respect your choices. 

Step 5:
Narrow down your options based on the characteristics that you are looking for in your maid of honor. 

Step 6:
Choose the person who you believe will best be there for youboth at your wedding, the reception and while you are planning the wedding. 

"
9868,55189,"Congratulations on your engagement. You are in the best place to hold a large wedding. Outside of California (because that's where i'm from), DC has several places that are perfect for large weddings. It all depends on the style and look you're going for. 
When is the wedding? Are you looking for outside or inside venues?

If you're looking for a place with a wonderful waterfront setting and good food, try the Chart House in Old Town Alexandria. They hold about 400. Depending on your budget, another nice place for a reception is l'Enfant Plaza Hotel which is in SW D.C. I believe it holds close to 500. One last option (depending on the wedding date), may be the new hotel at the Harbor. 

Good luck to you.

10760,58465,"I'm getting married on family property that is scenic so it was sentimental reasons. I think one thing for you to consider is:  what works for you? If family is all over the place-  and they have to travel , most likely,no matter what- why not get married where you are so planning is more convenient??"
10614,58465,"you might want to include the weather- carmel can be chilly and it is outdoor in April. What about a schedule/ start time? Also, did you note wedding site location parking details?  It's a gorgeous spot, btw , congrats!
"
10508,58465,"why not?  do what you want and btw, with wedding planning, you'll always find someone to say 'you can't' do something or 'you have to' do something. Get used to it : )

"
10348,58465,"I know someone who had a very informal wedding and they basically were under their altar  (more like just their wedding spot)  waiting for everyone to file in. It was a small wedding so it worked (it wouldn't work if you were waiting on 100  people to be seated) I am in a similar position and I am considering that we'll just walk together, hand in hand."
10767,58465,"why not?  It would be the unexpected. Also, 'dressed up' BBQ will seem more like you could afford 'fancy' but chose BBQ  : )"
10643,55189,"Hi Danielle,
Baltimore typically has large venues, but depending on your budget you can find something nice that will accomodate what you're looking for. So, you're looking for a place to hold a ceremony and sit down dinner? Are you open to places outside of Baltimore? I know a few that are in PG county that are very intimate because of their size.

Let me know if you need some help.
Good Luck to you!

10736,54566,"Hi Tiffany, 
I am planning a Carnival Cruise in June for our honeymoon. I've never been on one before and am so excited. Here's what I know from my travel agent. 1) The summer is full of kids, they market to get families. But I think in November most kids should be in school so I don't think you have to worry. 
2) The popular areas on ship are croweded, but there are other options, you just have to be willing to go to a different area if you don't like the crowd. Like PP said, the main pool was packed on her cruise. If you don't like that you may have to go to another
FI and I are very laid back and dont see any of that bothering us. They do charge a $10 a day pp fee and now are adding another $5 a day pp to that for ""fuel charge"" so be sure you read all the small print and budget accordingly. (And watch those drinjs, lol. They will add up since they get billed to your tab)

I hope you have a great time!"
9831,55189,"Hi Jessie,
I am an event planner, but i also work in a bridal store in my free time (whenever that is) lol. So we deal with a lot of tuxedo rentals for weddings and formals. Here are the guidelines:

A white jacket (ivory, actually) is a good alternative from mid-April to Labor Day.
(excerpt taken from BBG)
Technically, before 6 pm you should wear a morning coat   (frequently pearl grey) with a waistcoat, ascot, and stiff white shirt. That being said, you'll rarely see some guy dressed that way (unless he's driving a vintage Rolls, and even then, come on, dude) and we doubt anyone will say anything if you choose to just sport a dinner jacket instead.
Semi-formal (after 6 pm) means a tuxedo,  black bow tie and matching cummerbund. This is appropriate for black tie events. 
Formal is really formal, as in a tailcoat  (which is rarely worn these days) and white tie, with a white waistcoat.  These days, ""formal"" means roll with your (own) tuxedo.

10748,54566,"I can appreciate wanting to get married. If you really want to do it, I would elope. If you are in need if the pell grant to pay for school I don't think you should be spending our money on a wedding. Even the smallest wedding gets expensive. If you and your boyfreind are comitted to each other it shouldn't be a problem to wait for a bit. As for your parents, they do have your best intrest at heart I'm sure, but ultimately it is your life. Just be smart and think things through. Alos, try to listen to why they are telling you to wait. They probably have some good points for you to consider.

Good Luck and congrats on finding the man you want to spend the rest of your life with!"
10759,39625,"Hi Shauntae,
the best way to pick colors is by season, especially since the colors affect bridesmaids dresses, flowers & decor, ect. Also look at where your reception is being held, is it outdoors or indoors? The atmosphere? 
Spring is perfect for pastels; summer colors can be more vibrant. In autumn, a collection of browns and rich jewel tones work well; whites and metallics are great for holiday and winter weddings.
If you're interested in floral suggestions after you select a palette of colors, let me know. I can give you a list of flowers to suit you color scheme, so you'd be able to visit a florist and see what's available with a list of flowers you may like.
Good Luck!"
10767,39625,"Hi Barbara, 
(for one of my weddings) I'm actually having an outdoor garden reception with catered BBQ, and it's also going to be summer casual, so khakis and sun dresses. I have gorgeous lace linens, bone china, gold millet and tea light candles everywhere, and a bunch of everything else.  And I'm still serving BBQ. So do what you would like, it's beyond acceptable. And it would surprise your guests, in a good way!
Good Luck"
10758,20989,"Is your vase clear or solid?  If it's clear with hearts and ladybugs on them, I would put pretty colored stones on the bottom, and float one gerber daisy in each, using red and pink daisies.  If they are solid, I wouldn't put flowers in them because of the lack of height.  You said the atmosphere is fun, could you go a completely different route and put candy in them for your guests to nibble on before dinner?  You could do red, pink, and black M&M's, or foil wrapped chocolate (you could probably find ladybug candy pretty easy).

Good luck!"
10751,26987,"Position in the wedding party will be a clear indication to all your guests that she is the matron of honor. Also her name and title appears in the wedding program.  She will also be making the toast at your reception. So from start to end it will be clear she has a place of honor in your ceremony."
10680,26987,"According to Emily Post Book 
Wedding Etiquette 
""When a wedding is very small-restricted to family only , and perhaps with no reception-the couple may be given a shower to which friends are invited who would have been included at a larger wedding. The shower, in this case, almost takes place of the reception, and the shower gifts are given instead of (rather than in addition to) wedding gifts""."
5697,62027,"do you even need flowers?  we did not have any flowers at all at my wedding.  i've been to one other wedding without flowers and it can be absolutely lovely.  the other wedding i went to everyone walked down with a single candle, it was very elegant.  For my wedding they carried vases with sand (something for later in the ceremony) and left the vases on the stage and stood empty handed the rest of the ceremony.  no one even seemed to notice that there were no flowers.  i think if you need to cut costs, flowers is a good place to start.  p.s my wedding colors were the same!  :)"
99,62027,"i think you need to know where your spouse stands.  if they are bothered by it then you need to take that into consideration and get rid of them.  after all they are who you are with now.  if they don't care then think about why you want to keep them.  as long as there is no sentiment there, i don't see why not.  i've kept some.  not mementos because those are from a past relationship but pictures and i don't see a reason to keep something that was significant like that but pictures, especially if they involve other people, why not."
5682,62027,"you simply apologize and say you have to stick to a strict number.  DO not let anyone try and make you do something you do not want on your special day."
4730,62027,"it's a personal issue.  we did not have children at my wedding.  i didn't want to deal with them or make there parents have to deal with them.  instead the parents could leave their children with the baby sitter and enjoy the celebration.  "
10736,57903,"I have been on two Carnival cruises and loved them both. I never want to go home after those cruises. My family came with me on the second one and they felt the exact same way. The last one that I went on was the week after 7/7/07 and there were plenty of newlyweds on the cruise. There were a lot of kids too however. I dont think that any of the newlyweds seemed very bothered by the kids, they have their parents and own programs to entertain them. I would definitely recommend carnival."
10751,2723,"The answers you've received here are excellent. One more thing that could differentiate her from the bridesmaids is to allow her to wear a long gown and the bridesmaids could wear a short gown.

Definately design her bouquet to be much more significant that the bridesmaids as well, but not as wondeful as yours.

Good luck with all of your planning."
10614,46106,"Great ideas - thanks!!"
10736,55641,"So wait, drinks are not included in the price? I thought cruises were all-inclusive?"
10777,26987,"According to Peggy Post-(Modern Day Etiquette Expert)
Her advice is as follows:""It is OK to ask for Money as a gift. If money is the gift you would most appreciate, get the word out to family and close friends.If you are asked point blank what you would like, you might say, ""Whatever you want to give us is wonderful, the choice is yours, but money is at the top of our wish list."" It's also a good idea to state the intended purpose. Perhaps you are saving for a down payment on a house. Guests will then know how their gift may be used. Indeed, monetary gifting is a preferred bridal gift among couples and guests alike. Post points out that wedding guests, too, often ask if money is an acceptable gift. In a word, Post replies: absolutely! Nowadays, registry information is often included with the bridal shower invitations. This is an acceptable method of getting the word out as well, and is certainly convenient. Registry information should not be included with the wedding invitation."
10760,57840,"Hi Shauntae,

My husband and I married in 2006 and we also had the same problem.  All of his family is from Saratoga, NY and we live in Ga.  Since, all my family was helping pay for the wedding and his wasn't.  We decided to have it in Ga. and invited all the family up there and the one's that could join us did.

My husbands in the National Guard, so I understand money issues.  I looked into the most affordable places and then some.  
Since I'm a coordinator, I planned my own wedding and that helped a lot.  Although, when it is your own you tend to get more stressed out as I did.

But, please email me if you have anymore questions.  I'll try to direct you to the right places and people if I can.

My philosophy is, you don't have to spend $20,000 to have a fabulous wedding.  I didn't and I have helped many brides stick to their budget and save money.  There is no reason to go into a marriage full of debt."
10748,56581,"Definitely talk to your parents, but if that doesn't work out and if you and your FH feel strongly about getting married on 7/4/09, check out the marriage laws in neighboring states. Your marriage would be legally recognized no matter where you get married, so having the legal ceremony performed in another state like Louisiana or Alabama and then having a non-legal ceremony and reception back home may be an option. You're old enough to vote, buy cigarettes, and die for your country, you should be able to decide when you get married too!"
10767,56581,"If only your closest friends and family will be there, go for the BBQ! I'm sure most of them know that BBQ is your FH's favorite and having BBQ doesn't mean you have to sacrifice the china and other elegant touches. I am planning on doing BBQ for my reception (50-80 guests) and I'm not even about trying to dress it up. I think my close friends and family will be more concerned with having delicious food to eat than if it is an ""elegant meal"" and I'm sure the same is true for your guests. Just make sure there are plenty of napkins, wet naps, and maybe even bibs on hand. "
10767,4007,"Think ""Gone with the Wind"" and the barbeque at Twelve Oaks! Or Maybe Abercrombie & Fitch (the Safari company that outfits it guests with silver service and china on the Serengeti)It could be absolutely stunning!"
10777,4007,"Well, I guess I'm of the Emily Post/Miss Manners/ Etiquitte Grrls school. Its never OK to ask for a gift of any sort, and it would be presumptious to expect that someone is giving you one. That being the case, a request or hint of a request (like a registry card) should not be included in the wedding invitation. Perhaps in a shower invitation, because the idea is to ""shower"" you with gifts. The most ideal way to explain this is word of mouth.The second best way I can think of is on a wedding website under the registry section. There you can explain the above situation. "
10758,4007,"Just as an FYI - while it is terribly romatic to marry on Valentine's Day, the wholesale price of flowers about tripled this year during Valentine's week. What about filling the vases with pink & white candies (good n plenty?) with ane LED votive nestled inside?"
10678,4007,"Try Mikel Olssen out of Tacoma - I'm not where I can get to his info right now, but he's a nice guy & does a nice ceremony. If you let me know the church you attend, I could give you some other ideas this week."
10760,4007,"Look at it this way: you're planning a huge party - if you're paying, planning, and hosting, you should pick a location that works for you. It could be a destination, a place you're familiar with like Charleston, or where you live now (but it should be a place where the hosts can be hosts.) Does that help? I would also look at all of the above & do a little price shopping,as that may make a huge difference in what you do. Good Luck!"
10760,53835,"well with my fiance and myself, our immediate family is from around where we live but i also have family from out of state so we went with something that was close to us and easy for my family to get to. both our ceremony and reception sites are private homes with a lot of property. since we are on a small budget it was more convenient for us to choose something that would be free for us and i am sure that you or your fiance have family that have some really nice property. since your wedding date is in April then i would make sure that if you want it to be outside that the weather is going to be nice and if not the you could try a VFW or a small hall such as that to do an indoor wedding that is also not very expensive. i hope that this helps."
10758,53835,"i am a major candle person. so on that note you can try the tall floating candles with a pink LED light in the bottom of the vase. you can also try some silk flowers or silk flower peddles in pink and red or pink and black and float them in the water with some shiney stones in the bottom and put a few tea light candles around the bottom of it to light it up a little and set the romantic mood since it will be valentines day."
10751,53835,"i have three wedding colors, one main color and two colors that are going to be incorporated into the rest of the wedding so you could make it so that your bridesmaid is wearing a dress that is say blue and your matron of honor is wearing one that is blue with some pink flowers or some green trim to it."
10799,58465,"I found a ton by googling but this is the one I bookmarked:

"
10748,31333,"Well here's the thing (I only had so much room to explain in the original post).  I want to get a grant so that that's extra money we won't have to spend.  And I'll be in my last year of school after we get married (it's a 2 year program at a community college down the road).  I also want a part time job (that would be something to distract me while he's gone away on jobs - I'm with a company right now that I can transfer from store to store so that I can be closer to my school).  So it's not a matter of just absolultely needing the money for school or me just going to school while he pays all the bills.  He says he doesn't have a problem with that either (and his grandmother even suggested it).  And you can get a full pell grant if you're married because it's based on your income (I know mothers that go to school with me on full grants).  I guess I should have explained all this in a second post after I posted the first.  Thought I'd clear the air and explain everything.    "
10798,41195,"heres an idea have personalized fortune cookies made where they ask them as the fortune!
"
10798,5242,"Have T-shirts made that say ""Bridesmaid"" and then one that's says Maid of Honor. "
10468,5242,"Use the beach and it's colors as your theme with the added touch of Martha Stewart or Shabby Chic. I have photographed a back yard wedding where she had the wedding dress and they guys wore tan suits with white shirts and colored ties & flip flops. I have been to a beach wedding where they took the whole Hawaiian approach. They guys wore leis and flowered shirts with kaki pants, the girls had dresses that matched. The bride wore a sleek wedding dress and the groom had on the kaki pants and cream Hawaiian shirt with a leis also. Very casual reception. 

Hope this helps you out some more. "
10734,50366,"I would offer to pay for the additional guests, you are still getting a ""bargain""."
10748,26876,"It seems like you may have it all figured out. So what exactly do you want to hear(read)? Are you just trying to convince your parents about them letting you get married before your 21? Like I had posted before, I would just get school out of the way. I know that is not what you want to hear(read), but its a very smart thing to do. You want to be able to enjoy your marriage to the fullest without having to worry about I have term papers due, and all this stuff that is due and have little time with your husband. Your fiance may say he doesnt mind the bills, my husband said the same thing. He hasn't told me he minds now, but I know him well enough to say that he wishes I was done with school already. I wish too that way we can go travel around the world. Anyway, just wanted to throw that out there anyway, but I think you may have already made up your mind. SO good luck hope everything turns out well for you. "
9998,53299,"Thank you everyone for your responses, but I think we have found a DJ!"
10809,10122,"If you have secured your wedding officiant, they should have already asked you the style/feel of ceremony you want along with any readings, additional ceremonies (unity candle, sand, rose etc.)you would like incorporated into your ceremony. There really should be no guess work on your part, as the officiant should be laying out the entire ceremony for you. As a wedding officiant myself, I always email my clients their ceremony to read through once completing it, so that there is no guess work as to how things will proceed. This also allows for my brides and grooms to request any changes at that time as well.

Best Wishes to you.    "
10759,57238,"I looked at my favorite colors and went with two that look good together."
10816,5242,"I love this idea!

I helped a friend with this. She found some labels that were in the shape she needed for the bottles. I made the logo and printed them and she put them on. Im sorry Im no help on where she found them, but Im thinking like a office supply place. That way you can buy the bottles at a Sam's Club/Costo kinda place. 

Then she found two tubs in her colors and we put them in there with some ice. 

Good Luck!

10813,11213,"I've been on Carnival, Celebrity, & Royal Caribbean 3 times.  I love all of them.  All have been excellent service.  I've been on 3-4 day cruises & 14 day cruises.  The longer the cruise the older the people.  I'm 51 & when I mean older I mean 70s & 80's.  I asked some of the crew about this & they said older people can affort the time off & the extra $ it takes for the longer cruises.  I have never had a bad experience on any.  They say Carnival has a more party croud but I didn't find that at all.  As a matter of fact the last RC we were on was the biggest party of them all & I like that. We're trying Norweigeon in April.  I like the free style cruising.  I don't like to dress up & I want to eat with who ever I want & when I want.  That's just me. Last time I asked RC for a table for two & we got it.

10823,59546,"Hi Becky. What if you utilized a florist's foam block to arrange your flowers in a vase (of any shape or height) but then used the sand to cover the foam? This way it will look like your flowers are just floating out of the sand. If you choose a clear vase, you can also add shells throughout the sand to add that visual element to the centerpieces. You can probably find shells that coordinate with the color selection of the flowers.

Let me know if need any help!

Best,
Jessica"
10826,54821,"Hello!

A basic program generally has the ""Order of the Ceremony"" is listed out, sometimes in detail with the names of any readers and names of the songs, and perhaps a little message from the bride and groom to their guests or thanking important people involved, and a list of the wedding party participants.

A more detailed program might also include short a short bio of each person in the wedding party, a verse or reading special to you, and/or a map to the reception location.

I hope that helps!

10860,58465,"oh wow. that's awful to hear.  You don't say how big the wedding guest list is;  that might make a difference. If it is a smaller list than maybe you set up a wedding website with information and have your family pitch in to make calls and direct people to it. It would be a good, informative, inexpensive solution. 

If it's a large guest list- than maybe new invites, with a little notice explaining what happened and to ignore the 1st one should they get it...??

good luck  : )"
10865,60300,"I am going to answer this question for a personal and a professional view.

I got married almost 2 years ago and my mother (a floral designer) insisted silk flowers.  I protested all the way to the wedding, she WON, and I LOVE HER FOR IT!!! They look and spelled so wonderful!! My bouquet,bout is in my wall cabinet for all to see and as fresh as it was that day!  The best part No one new they were silk!  We heard so many comments ""those floral bouquets are beautiful, they must have set you back a few"" LOL.. we laughed alot at those comments....

Now on a professional view: Fresh flowers are VERY expensive right now. They are very stunning and wonderful scent about them. Your right How long will they last?

10767,60300,"For one of my weddings we did an ""upscale"" bbq. 
This wedding I did was very similar in many ways. What we decided to do was place food in Ivory/Gold trimed bowls or serving trays and do a stunning decorated buffet to match decor.

My suggestion would be keep everything as you have planned, (which sounds wonderful) just place food in your china, and use your linens... 

Best Wishes,"
10748,60300,"I congratulate you on finding love.

I believe everyone has posted wonderful comments and solid responses. 
I have to honestly stand by with the first poster.  
I am in the same situation as she is in. 
Although my opinion is you both should be complete with your educations before a new marriage begins.  Your still learning about one another.  You will discover things about one another you thought you knew but didnt, love things you didnt and dislike things you did before.. Marriage is wonderful and a powerful thing. But not to be taken to lightly. The beginging of your marriage needs nurturing.
So my suggestion would be to wait until you both are out of school and spend that time focusing on the both of you...

I hope that makes sense.."

9831,60300,"Jessi, good evening!
I am a wedding planner as well and also work  in a bridal store part time an love the comment the previous poster made ""what ever part time that is""  I got married 2 years ago in May my husband wore White jacket, black pants, with a color cordinating vest. He was so handsome that day!  Dont worry about anyone else.. Do what the both of you want!"
5697,60300,"I have done several weddings with one flower to save on budgets! 
I have done Tulips with ribbon. 
A rose with babies breath.
The Classic and popular Calla Lilly, decorated in many ways!
I have done daisies..
Your choice!
What is your favorite flower and color?"
5495,60300,"I haven't personally done any of blue wedding gowns. I am a wedding planner and work in a bridal store as well and I sell colored gowns often. At first I thought it was odd and off tradtion, then quickly remembered what I tell all my brides, times have changed with traditions.. I would agree with your plans! They sound stunning. I would dress your bridemaids in Shimmering Silver w/white and bkl accents.

Just ideas.  Let me know how it goes.."
3433,60300,"As you will find I have been stating I got married coming up on 2 years in may. I too found my wedding dress in a store for honestly $3500.  I did some researching and I found a designer in China who made the exact gown and i paid $175. I just had to send in my measurements.  Yes I was a little leary at first. They stayed in constant contact with me, giving me every detail of what step they were on.
My gown arrived in the same quality as the designer gown if not BETTER quality. 
And I work in a bridal store!

So I praise it if you find the right designer..."

10799,21407,"Your florist/decorator should be able to get them for you. There are many wholesale suppliers that carry them and sell them to vendors in the wedding industry.  "
10701,21407,"Our last experience with Carnival has us changing cruise lines. As the ship wasn't sold out- they had a special running for families in the Puerto Rico port where the ship was sailing from.  The ship was over run with kids, and rather than move full paying guests up to better rooms, the discounted ticket buyers all got the expensive cabins. We paid far more than the sell off ticket holders, and got less.  Many complaints were made to Carnival from full paying customers, but nothing was done. After 3 cruises with them, we will never use them again. "
10865,21407,"Being a decorator/florist I get asked the question a lot-what should I use. This year, I only have 2 brides using fresh florals, all the others are going aritificial.  The silks that florists get are high end and you can't tell the difference. These are not Walmart silks,they are much better quality. Some artificial for example like the Floramatique line, can be more expensive. There are real touch-made from latex, and then the Floramatique that are not.The real touch look and feel real. If you go fresh, there are companies that will preserve your bouquet in pristine condition, however it is expensive. Another alternative is to put the bridesmaids in artificial and you could have fresh florals. If you look at my blog under alternative flowers, you will see the difference between real touch, and Floramatique- www.specialdaydesign.wordpress.com the processing of these flowers is explained there.  "
10767,20989,"In my hometown there is a very famous bbq joint, it's basically the go-to place when you want to impress or really celebrate.  So they cater everything from weddings to CEO board meetings.  These are elegant events and the bbq is not out of place at all.

My suggestion, if it is possible, is to do ""clean"" bbq.  You can keep it clean by doing herb rubs on the meat to give it a lot of flavor, rather than drowning it in sticky sauces.  Same goes for the sides - rely on spices rather than oils or butter.  Then you can use the potentially hazardous sauces in moderation.

Good luck!"

10841,26876,"I would send a general invite to both. THINK GREEN!! It wouldn't make sense for them to be in separate cars.

10865,26876,"I had fresh floral, but that was because I didn't want to deal with keeping the silk arrangements afterwards. I did have some silf floral though, and I agree fresh flowers can be a waste of money. I had a vey small budget for flowers, for that same reason. What I would suggest is maybe having the bouts with fresh flowers, I don't think guys would want to keep a silk bout for a momento. Maybe if your going to have a special women wear a corsage or chest corsage, have that with real flowers. "

10701,22903,"I just got back from a carnival cruise last week.  We are a 25 year old couple that got married in Aug.  We were very disapointed.  They nickle and dime you to death!!  You can't even get a pop without having to pay for it even though they say that non alcholic drinks are included.   We thought that we were on a geriatric cruise.  Everyone was either very old or morbidly obese.  The only 2 things to do were play bingo or go to the casino.  Everywhere you go you stand in line.  We found the 3 other couples that were our age and they all said that they were very disapointed too.  I have been to all inclusives for the last 10 years before this so I may have been spoiled by that.  My fave one is Barcelo Maya in the Mayan Rivera in Mexico.  So relaxing and much higher class than Carnival.  Hope this helps!"

Since you've made a change anyway, consider it a blessing (albeit mixed!)You can quickly create a classic white or ivory panel card invitation with the corrected invitation and get those out asap. But calling and a web-site will be great tools for you. In fact, I had a client use her wedding site for RSVPs and it worked very well. The web page will very likely have a ""last updated"" notation on it somewhere, so a quick check of the postmark will help those in question sort it out. On the web page you can also note the change and mailing problem. Good luck (& don't forget to breathe - you've already talked to most of your guests, so it will work out!)"

10892,46106,"I think how into the wedding he is just depends on him.  My fiancé has been really into the wedding and involved in the planning, but I know a lot of guys just aren't that interested.  That doesn't mean they don't appreciate the end product, though!  We talked a couple times about eloping - there are so many advantages!  Money, less stress, super-intimate...  In the end we decided to have a small (30 guests) wedding.  It sounds like you're doing an awesome job with your budget and planning!  I think if it were me, I'd wait til he's in a good mood and you're feeling calm to bring it up again.  Let him know how important having a wedding is to you, and listen (again) to his concerns.  Maybe you can go over the budget together and try to identify ways to cut back even further to put it back more in his comfort zone.  Try to keep it a calm, frank discussion.  You definitely want to come to a conclusion that will make you both happy.  Good luck and let us know how it goes!"
10893,46106,"I think it would be adorable!"
10892,26876,"I'll tell you what, there are two things that most guys aren't in too and thats spending money and weddings. Put them both together and you get what you have your typical groom. I know its stressful, but your going to stress yourself out more by getting worked up over your fiance. Your having a small wedding so it shouldn't be as stressful as having 100+ people, so do what you need to do, and just let him meet you at the end of the aisle. The more you push him the more he will push back. If your sticking to your budget GREAT! Be proud of yourself and just think if you would still be in budget if you had his thoughts and opinions about your wedding? Your very close to your date, so invest more time in your wedding than in wanting him to be into it. Fiance's are, but in their own way, and we sometimes don't see that and take it the wrong way. It'll all work out, you'll see."

You should consider looking into RC it was amazing...The staff was great, everyone was really nice and helpful in making our vacation a relaxing time to remember. Although I went with my family...I bet It would be simply amazing for a honeymoon!!!!"
10895,26876,"Sandals is nice, but overrated. There are so many couples that go on their honeymoons it seems like there is a lack of privacy. Its nice that its all inclusive, but with so many couples they get, the service is your average if not below that. Im not sure what your budget is for a honeymoon, but have you considered maybe the british virgin islands, not many go there there is more privacy. For me the biggest downfall on Sandals resorts is the lack of privacy, its hard to enjoy yourself to the fullest without being conscious of the many many couples around you, also there are so many drinking and go overboard withit. The last thing I want on my honeymoon is being annoyed by people who are drunk and have no respect for others. "

The sooner you order the better. Also, if you order now, make sure you ask them for a slightly larger size so that they can be altered locally when your wedding date approaches! Good luck!

10860,42429,"Hi,
Here are some suggestions.  Enlist your bridal party to call people on the list.  This will help spread the word and you won't have to spend hours talking to everyone!  I would suggested making a website for updates and RSVPs.  
If you want to still send out new invitations, I can help you with that, there is plenty of time.  I make personalized invites and work within any budget.  I would suggest using something simple, such as a one sided invite with reception card and rsvp card.  
Please let me know if I can help you in any way.

10826,42429,"Hi Stephanie,
A program is generally a guideline for your guests so they know approximately how long the ceremony is going to be or who the bridal party is.  
These are newer items for a wedding, so basically you can do what you want. For my program, it was a fan because it was an outside wedding.  It gave a very brief listing of the events in the ceremony, listed all the parents names and then gave a few sentences on each attendant.  This was people would have an idea of who was who. Because how many wedding have you been to and you have no clue whos who in the bridal party.
If you need any help designing or creating a program please don't hesitate to ask me. I specialize in custom and personalized invitations and programs.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth

10893,31333,"That is a good idea.  It's not tacky at all.  In fact, I've seen it done in magazines.  You can use like tall cylindrical vases and fill them with summer fruits or just glass bowls and leave a notecard that says ""Enjoy!"""
10751,42429,"As said previously, positioning and speech will let people know that she is the maid of honor.  I allowed my maid of honor to wear her hair up, similar to mine, the other bridesmaid wore theirs down. They all had the same bouquets and same dresses. This was really the only thing different about her. 
I hope this helps

10013,62791,"I love the idea of white and ivory flowers with lots of greenery.  What do you think  of a gold tone base or vase? "
10751,31333,"Since they'll be wearing different dresses, make hers a little more special and make the other dress a little more plain.  Maybe add some trim as said before or a more distinctive skirt line (like maybe hers can have a small slit if it's floor length).
Hope this helps!"
10865,31333,"Another thing to think about is allergies.  Maybe some of your guests are allergic to pollen?  That's something I considered in making my decision between real and silk.  All of the other ladies provided wonderful suggestions.  Just thought I'd throw the allergy thing out there (one of my bridesmaids pointed out her allergies to pollen)."

10618,63519,"I have a similar situation in my wedding with an uneven Bridal party. One of my fiance's good friends recently passed away, and he would have been a groomsmen. For the longest time, my fiancee was just trying to find someone to find someone, but we realized that this person really can't be replaced and so when the bridal party walks out (normally in 2's ) at the end of the ceremony, the Best Man will walk out with 2 of my Bridesmaids instead of one, and that will work just fine. In the program we are still going to list our friend that past away as a groomsmen, but with ""in loving memory of"" next to it. Its your wedding girl, you do what will best suit you guys!"

10197,59753,"You could always let your guests know that they pick their seeting, have the only seating that is assigned for you and the groom. Then let everyone else pick where they sit, that way if families get split up, they chose to do it not you."

3460,59753,"Just remember...You are paying for your guests to come(food, gifts, etc.)Hope this helps!"
10809,33247,"You may also check with a coordinator (on-site or other) to get the behind the scenes ceremony info. Etiquette and tradition advisement, what side is for who, the order the wedding party enters in, the amount of time between each person entering, who's going to open the doors, who's going to cue the music, etc... There's a lot of details that go into making a ceremony go off without a hitch. It's also a good idea to do a rehearsal the day before the wedding, so there aren't any questions or surprises on the wedding day."
10777,33247,"Try registering with places like...

www.aperfectweddinggift.com (for monetary gifts)
www.honeymoonwishes.com (for honeymoon contributions)
www.marriottregistry.com (for hotel accommodations and activities)

I agree that you shouldn't ""ask"" for money from wedding guests. It's always best to have a traditional gift registry with a store like Target (www.clubwedd.com) or Kohl's (www.kohls.com), with at least a few household items to choose from...then you can add additional registries like the ones above, depending on what you want to use the money for.

Also keep in mind the ""Dollar Dance"". Variations of it are a tradition in several different cultures. A coordinator or wedding party member holds a basket, and guests pay a dollar to dance with the bride and groom. The DJ can make an announcement that a dollar is required, but more is definitely welcomed...I've seen the dollar dance money baskets flow over before!"

Any event design company should be able to pull that style of canopy together quite easily and inexpensively."
10760,33247,"Traditionally, the wedding is held in or near the bride's home town. These days, traditional isn't always the case.

If the bride and groom are paying for the wedding themselves, they can choose to hold the wedding wherever they like. If parents and families are contributing, they may have a say in where the wedding is held. 

My husband and I paid for our weddingby ourselves. I'm from Texas originally, but live in Ohio now. Instead of having my husband's large family all travel to Texas, we had my small family travel here to Ohio. Not traditional, but it worked out better for everyone involved.

If both families are from different areas, you might also consider a destination wedding, a neutral spot that everyone would travel to."
10758,33247,"It's hard to know what will work with the vase without seeing it...but for a Valentine's wedding I would suggest lots of candles to give a romantic glow. 

Real roses are going to be at their most expensive prices that time of year. If you're on a strict budget, you could consider silk roses instead, or artificial rose petals to sprinkle around the centerpieces and on the tables. 

If your wedding colors are pink and red, I'd stick with pink and red roses or petals. Trying to bring in too many colors usually turns into a train wreck..."
10751,33247,"Since you have one bridesmaid and one matron of honor, and they are wearing the same color dress, I'd suggest giving the matron some extra ""umph"" in her bouquet. Have her and the bridesmaid carry the same flowers, only accent the matron's with some crystals, jewels and/or extra ribbons.

She will also have her place next to you in the ceremony to hold your bouquet while you exchange vows and rings, which will also distinguish her from the bridesmaid."
10680,33247,"Yes, a shower is still acceptable. I would suggest a couples shower/party after the wedding (but not in place of the dinner reception). Maybe after the honeymoon, or in the weeks following the wedding. Invite those who weren't at the ceremony to attend and congratulate the newlyweds."
10644,33247,"These days brides are making the task of asking their bridal party to participate in her wedding even more special. Send the maid/matron of honor flowers with a request for her to honor you on your special day. Have a spa day with your group, or invite everyone to dinner, and ask them all together at once. Or, you could even send special hand-made cards asking ""Will you be my..."". Follow up your request with a phone call to make it personal... 

Be creative and give the wedding party a memory or momento to keep and remember forever..."
10895,48497,"I know people that have been to Sandals resorts and they had a GREAT time!!!  Some have gone a couple times and will more in the future.  I looked into and asked around about different places to go and heard many great things about Sandals.  Not only with them being all inclusive, but there was many things to do.  For our honeymoon, we decided to go to Florida for a week, and then a 9-night Royal Caribbean cruise a couple months later.  It just works out timing wise, along with the port we leave out of is only 3.5 hours away from us.  That, along with the fact that the price of it is VERY reasonable!  Plus I look forward to being able to travel to a few places along the cruise.  Having been on a Carnival Cruise before, I really enjoyed it!!!"

10510,33247,"I agree with the earlier postings..

1. Get it in writing - all coordinators should have a list of the duties they will perform for you, down to the tiniest details.

2. An outside coordinator works for you, an on-site coordinator works for the site. On-site coordinators generally handle the details on the venue's end that are required to host an event...not the special personal touches you add to your own wedding (favors, decor, centerpieces, menu cards, etc...)

3. If you hire an outside coordinator, they should work with the on-site coordinator to make sure all details are covered. While the venue can handle the logistics, the outside coordinator can handle the wedding's personal details."
10893,39625,"I think this is a really unique idea. I actually sent a few of these in my place to my cousins bridal shower and everyone thought they were awesome: http://www.ediblearrangements.com/
I called them because they wanted to use them as place card holders for each person, and they didn't have anything like that on the site. So you may want to call and ask if they can do centerpieces in your price range!
Or you might just want to check out the page for your own centerpiece ideas!
Best of Luck!

10429,33247,"My only brother (and a younger brother, at that) gave me away at my wedding. We are both in our 20's and share a lot of the same tastes. We chose a song called ""Sister"" by The Nixons. 

It had special meaning on several different levels...my new last name was to be Nixon, the band is from Dallas (just like my brother and I) and the words of the song just fit us perfectly. It is an alternative band that sings the song, but there is also an acoustic version that is beautiful and totally fitting for a wedding dance."
10408,33247,"I suggest a postcard that matches your invitation style to be sent as an update with the new reception location. You can also create a free wedding website for the younger, more computer savvy guests and direct them there."
10895,39625,"I have never been to a Sandals Resort. But my fiancé and I have been to a few One & Only resorts. They have resorts in Mexico, Bahamas, Mauritius, Maldives, and Dubai. We have been to the resort in the Bahamas and in Mauritius, (and he's been to the one in Mexico) - they were both amazing. We are actually going to spend a week at the One&Only in Dubai then off to One&Only resort Reethi Rah for a week in the Maldives for our honeymoon.  These places pride themselves on amazing service (you get your own butler!) and privacy. We dined on the beach alone, we laid in the sea (literally) drinking champagne, and slept in the most comfortable beds. The food was amazing at the resorts and everything was impeccable. We even enjoyed the spa so much we spent an hour each day we were there getting some type of treatment. My fav. was the Le Saint-Géran in Mauritius. Check them out. http://www.oneandonlyresorts.com/flash.html"
10142,33247,"In my experience as a wedding coordinator, most vendors do not expect tips. If they do expect tips, they generally figure it into the bill or package price. Caterers/Venues sometimes add on a service charge, limo services add on gratuity, etc....

Bartenders might expect tips....if you're having bartenders at your event, they might put out a jar for tips. I just saw that at a wedding last weekend, as a matter of fact."
10841,33247,"Of course spouses can be invited. They can just take a seat in the chapel or ceremony area and wait while the rehearsal goes on."
10475,33247,"It's not rude at all, it's actually quite traditional. Just have cards created after your wedding, with a picture of the bride & groom at the wedding, and send them out to friends and relatives who either weren't invited to the wedding or couldn't make it to the wedding."
10739,63646,"I went to this wedding last year in October and they had a tent.  Inside the tent there was a floor with black outdoor carpet on it & white furniture.  A love seat with two chairs and a glass coffee table in between the set up.  They had a total of 3 sets of these.  Then in another area they had those standing coctail tables near the bar area.  The Dj was set up with a dance floor of course.  There was fabric hung from the ceiling of the tent and drapped down so that it hung along the sides of the tent.  I was sooo amazed at how elegant this all looked inside the tent because it didn't look like a tent inside it looked beatuiful.  "
10759,33247,"First and foremost, you should choose a color palette with colors that you like. If you favorite color is pink, choose a pink that's fitting...pastel pink for spring, hot pink for summer, magenta or merlot for fall...

Then consult a color wheel to see what goes well with your main color. It will show you in detail what colors and shades work well together.

10927,53299,"Well first fo all who is paying for the wedding? You and your fiance, your fiances parents, or your parents? Just try and explain to her the vision of your wedding. Once she understands that you want it to look a certain way she should understand that the 60's are not the way to go. "
10927,44285,"My fiance will be mostly paying for the wedding.  I am sure that both of our parents will try to help out where they can, but neither of them are too well off."
10860,58712,"Hello,
Try not to panic, I know easier said then done. I agree with the other response you got earlier, that your invites were probably to heavy and you will end up with a stack of them needing extra postage.However you are not to late to just start over. I have seen something similar to this happen to one of my clients before, and it does work out. You will need to get started on it right away. I recommend reordering your invites, I do sell invitations but please don't take this as a sales call, just a few tips. However if you do need help I can probably have them ordered and shipped to you in less than a week. I would recommend getting one full invitation prepared for mailing, have the post office weigh it and give you the correct fee for each invite before mailing them. Also I would have an email adress on the invites to RSVP as well as a phone # and respond date and do away with the response cards altogether in turn this saves you money and a quicker response method.Best wishes. "
10644,57238,"If at all possible I'd do it face to face.  If you can't a phone call's best.  Most of my bride's maids live about a 10 hour drive away from where I am so I called most of them.  It's just more personal that texting or anything else."
10930,53299,"It is understandable that you would want to make everyone happy, but if you make everyone else happy you are going to be the one that is unhappy. 

Just let your mother know that you do not wish to change the date AGAIN. If you are starting to talk to churches and vendors and you told them your date already then you are most likely going to have to stay with 9/6/08.

Just remember it is ultimately your decision no matter who pays and if your mother seems to be taking over then tell her you do not want the money anymore and have the wedidng that you and your fiance wanted form the beginning. 

Jessy"
10927,53299,"If your fiance is paying for the wedding then you can let you future mother in law know that you respect her decision and you will look at those places, but that you and your fiance will be making the final decision. "
10893,58712,"Hi,
I think this is a great idea. I have actualy seen this done before the bride wanted the fruit peices shaped into flowers and then placed into a bucket making it look like a potted plant. she added butterfly's on sticks to give it a garden effect. It was beautiful, tastey and the guest' enjoyed a snack while waiting for the bride and groom to arrive to the reception. The only thing you may want to think about is once the fruit is gone so are all of your center pieces. Be sure to ask the venue if you are able to bring these items into there facility or if they can make them for you. Good luck! "
10927,33247,"I'm sure you've heard this by now... but it's you and your fiance's wedding. You should make the decisions, especially if the two of you are paying for it. Parents can give opinions if they like and make any suggestions they want, but the ultimate decision is up to you and your fiance.
"
10789,53299,"It really hard to find a church that will allow this. I would just start calling churches. But just a reccomentation no Catholic church will allow unless you, your parents, your fince, or your fiance's parents are members. 

Best of luck!

Jessy"
10787,53299,"First of all, look at the contract that both you and the vendor signed. Mkae sure that what they did is stated in the contract, for example something like they are allowed to void the contract if they want to. But make sure there is a date (ex. 3 months) that is the cut off date. If there is not then you should go seek legal advice. 

Make sure that you MIL got ALL of here money back in full. Also try and speak with the manager asking about what they can do for you to compensate the fact that you have to look for a new vendor. ANd why in the world was it not in the books. 

Lastly, find a new vendor FAST!

Good luck.

Jessy"
5464,56479,"I think that is a good idea and that lets you know where your relationship really is and if you are doing the right thing becasue sex shouldn't be a main objective in your relationship. I am happy for the two of you do you cause nobody else can. "
10883,63131,"Thanks Sara!  The picture really helps.  I am trying to picture the lighter green - Clover - that david's bridal offers with the orage flowers.  Is the green dress in the picture the clover color at David's?  Thanks!"
10359,59942,"I agree and disagree as well. I think there is a fine line between ""supporting"" the bride as a member of the bridal party and the bride treating her bridal party as slaves, acting as if their own lives are supposed to be put on hold throughout the wedding planning and wedding day. It's a touchy situation sometimes. I have not been married but I have been in several weddings and have experienced horrific bridezilla's and then quite the opposite. I think you have to consider how you and the bride handle stress (together) and if it seems like it would work out or not. If you're not careful, friendships can be ruined...."
10649,59942,"My advice is to make a list of everything you want at your reception. Then, prioritize them in the order that is most important to you and your fiance. From there you can evaluate the list and possibly cut some things out that aren't truly important to incorporate into your reception. Location and number of guests are definitely going to be a HUGE factor in cost. I would then choose a theme/colors if you haven't already done so. Also, you might want to look into www.sponsoryourwedding.com. I own an online store (www.agnesavery.com) specializing in wedding favors, etc. and recently came across this company. If you haven't picked out favors or accessories yet I would be happy to work with you. "
10927,4007,"Well, if you and your fiance are paying, thank his mom sweetly for the suggestions and do check them out - they can be equite nice, or at least a great deal so you can afford to MAKE them nice, despite their name. If you just can't like the places, then move on, but its wiser to check out all your options AND make her happy that you tried in the mean time. Its worth swallowing a little pride now (even if you do hate the places she ID'd) and taking a look. Trust me, I have a mother-in-law who has been very difficult at times, but over the years we've worked it out. Sometimes she's even right!"
10420,59942,"Fall weddings are absolutely beautiful! I think what makes them so beautiful are the gorgeous colors that represent fall, oranges, browns, golds, dark greens, deep reds. There is something so crisp and romantic about the fall and it is one of my favorite seasons for weddings. "
10893,4007,"I had client who used smallish (8-10 servings) cakes on each table that were goregeous. SInce you were going to buy cake for them anyway, its a great way to go.
I also adore using fruit as a centerpiece. To glam it iup a bit, you can use a little guilder's past on apples & pear to give them a golden sheen. Citrus is a fab idea too."
10104,59942,"Navy and silver is actually really nice but the colors I've noticed to be ""up and coming"" are turquoise (or light blue) and emerald green. It kind of sounds funny at first but I've seen some absolutely gorgeous photos of weddings with these colors. It is young, fun and very elegant! It kind of incorporates winter on the verge of spring."
10898,4007,"If you are thinking a tradtional jewish wedding canopy, try seraching under chuppah or huppah. I know of several Seattle area companies that rent these, and I don't know where you are getting married, but a nice event rental company should have a few styles available."
10935,4007,"Its always nice to get an invitation on the mail, and that way you won't have that ackward feeling when you're NOT giving an invitation to someone else at the workplace. Simply ask the person in question for their mailing address (explaining that you are mailing an invitation, if need be.) THen you'll have that information on hand for thank you notes later."
10013,59942,"I agree with the burnt or pale orange to add to your existing colors. It will brighten it up without over doing it."
9577,4007,"I looked everywhere for rental benches in the Seattle area for a  client with no luck. I understand they are fairly easy to build, though. We considered hay bales, and also 2x12 boards on blocks. YOu could paint the boards to match that way! (They ended up going a different route for the ceremony, so we never went through with any of the above options.)"

9919,4007,"Of course, a planner would tell you to hire a planner, so - YES. Even if you're a super organizer, negotiator, and bargain hunter, you cannot realistically cue your wedding party down the aisle, nor can you arrange your own train, etc. etc. Please consider a professional for the rehearsal and day of, at least.
Association membership is nice, but its no substitute for experience. Likewise for hiring someone just starting out. You need someone calm, prepared and experienced to take the stress out of this busy and special day. Although I am no longer in Southern California (Seattle area now) and to help you with budgeting, my rehearsal and day of type package runs about $780. To get an idea of what a good planner can do for you, please read my reviews. They will give you an idea of the type of person you'll want to hire."
5682,4007,"Well, it really has nothing to do with whether its ""your day"" or not. It is THOR* for this person to ask  this- period! The answer is, ""No, I'm afraid I can't."" End of story, no apology or explanation needed

5464,4007,"Hooray for you two! This is a great decision! And BTW, cheating is not an option for any engaged or married person, yes for thousands of years men and women have been able to control themselves and not do so! (Additionally, I've been married 23 years, and before we married we made a conscious decision that divorce was not an option for us - ever.) To leave the door open for such things invites speculation, and can lead down a trail you don't want to take. Better to keep your standards high!"

Going to the Southern Carribean is a great deal because your in a differnet island every day so your not stuck on one island for a week."

The service and food was terrible, thank god for the snack bar where you can get burgers, fries, hotdogs and pizza. I've been on Carnival and Norwegain and had a blast.

10898,52913,"I took a look at the canopy on Oriental Trading and saw that it was SOLD OUT. Upon looking further I noticed that in the description it states what the canopy consists of and it sounds like something that you can construct on your own. The materials needed are:
32 square feet of sheer white fabric (such as tulle or sheer fabric which can be purchased inexpensively at your local fabric store or even Wal-Mart), 12 ft of ivy garland (again can be purchased at Wal-Mart or your local craft store), and by simply adding a cluster of tissue wedding bells (purchased on Oriental Trading) to accomplish the look of the canopy that you wanted.

10958,56581,"You may just need to asked her flat out what is going on that she doesn't seem interested in planning. Not every women wants to be involved with every single decision, so get a sense of what she does want to be involved with, if anything. If is just a matter of avoiding taking on tasks or it seems overwhelming to her, buying a wedding planning book/guide/system that you two can both use to get and stay organized could help. You might also want to bring up the topic of hiring a wedding coordinator/planner if its a possibility... You can also point her to this wonderful website and the community of support online here at WeddingWire. Best of luck!"
10942,18635,"Well for starters...what's her issue?  Maybe he needs to address her. What's the situation??

10967,26876,"Those were my exact colors for my wedding. It made my wedding look soooo classy, without spending a ton of money. My dress was white with claret red for the train, I actually used shades of reds, because its almost impossible to match all the reds. Check out my pictures. Its not a poor choice, there is not right or wrong color for a wedding, you could be married on chrismas and have orange and black for your colors. Who cares its your wedding. I personally think that black and white gives you a classy formal look. "
10958,26876,"Maybe, she's just not ready...as in planning a wedding. I dunno how long you have been engaged, maybe she'd like to enjoy the engagement before getting into the hassle of wedding planning. I find it funny that a Groom to be is complaining about the fiancee not getting into the planning. It could also be a money issue thing as well, again i dunno if your on a tight budget or not, but if so this might be making rethink about having a wedding. Is your wedding date a set date or just date for now. Just sit down and talk to her, ask her if she even wants a wedding, what is keeping her from starting to plan. Communication is KEY my friend...it really is. So talk to her for now, don't push her, just figure out whats going on in her head. Then you can decide from there, as a couple mind you. "
10935,26876,"I have read and heard, that if you cannot mail an invite for some odd reason, the next best thing is hand it to them personally. I see nothing wrong with that, you can also say a few nice words with your invite, I am sure it would mean a lot to them."
10468,58712,"I have done a few weddings on the beach. One of my girls got married in Ocean City with the sun setting it was beautiful. By the time the ceramony had ended the sun was almost completly down and talk about, takeing your breath away.Everyone was bare foot including the priest. They had an awsome photographer who took some realy great shots before and after the ceramony as well as on the board walk,the lights of the board walk in the background was beautiful also.Another wedding on the beach was done at Atlantic City NJ. We set up a small pavilion for the ceramony decorated in blues and greens (ocean colors) accents were sea shells and rafia, tiki torches and bamboo. the theme was ocean with natural accents. the reception was held at a hotel ball room with the same theme center pieces were tall cylinder style glass tubes with sea shells and sand in the bottom and beta fish swimming in them. We placed a card at each table on how to care for the fish if guests took them home. Good luck!"

10944,64155,"Nina, no matter what date you choose some people will have a conflict. The important part is to give plenty of time for people to plan... December is not a bad time to be in San Diego so if your guests are traveling from back east they will enjoy the break in the weather. Also, kids should be out of school by then. Down side is that travel and hotels will be more costly and harder to book. In any case the clock is ticking and if you want to have it this year you need to make the decision NOW...

I did want my fiance's opinion however so I wrote a list of 32 questions and had him answer them on his opinion.  From there I ask him stuff at random, but that was really all I needed.  It could be an idea for you?  To show her you are serious and you want her opinion."

10325,5912,"It depends a lot on your area. Larger cities will have higher prices, but they will also have a larger selection. Friday weddings can also be much less expensive than Saturday weddings.

In my case, I'm a wedding photographer in Atlanta. I think most of my couples are spending about 10-15% of their budget on their photography. My top-selling package runs about $4000. When shopping around, be sure to know what's included so you can do a true comparison. I include a lot in that price where other photographers may not include as much (or they may include more!)

Vendors are used to getting calls and emails with pricing questions. We understand you probably haven't done this before and are happy to help! Websites are also a good place to start. Mine, for example, states a ""starting"" price so that you have a rough idea before you call.

Hope this helps! Congrats and good luck!"
10967,55189,"I think black is very nice at weddings. It's very sophisticated. I used it at my evening wedding, although my accent color was gold.
As long as you have the other color in there, such as red...then it will definitely be nice. You don't want to use to much black though, because then it will get the feeling of a funeral instead of a wedding. 

Good Luck,

10734,50170,"Wowgirl,

  This is a genuine example that while relatives always mean well with their offer of help, in the end it causes friction, which is always what you want to avoid when having such an event.
  Unless you're sooo concerned with his feelings being hurt so badly that the friction may continue on for a while after the event, it is YOUR wedding and the guest list and it's size should be your choice. You could tell him that you really appreciate his help, explain to him that this is your event and it's what would make you happy to stay with the 150 person headcount, and if he's still upset at the thought of funding the additional guest, make the offer to pay for the additional yourself. But I don't think I would decrease the guest list, because then it might leave you with ill feelings afterward. And you don't want something like that casting a shadow over a wonderful event, right?"
10967,61337,"I agree with all the other responses I think those colors are flattering.  There are no rules when planning your own wedding.  My thought is the more different the better.  I love doing things that are considered to be outside the box

10927,61337,"Sometimes names can be deceitful.  I agree that most VFWs are not what most brides or even planners would consider to be an ideal location for a wedding.  But, what's the harm in looking?  You never know what might strike you.  Sometimes the places you expect to have the least amount of potential can turn out to be something great.  My recommendation is to just look at and if you don't like afterwards, just say so.  I'm sure your future mother-in-law is thinking how can she not like a place she's never seen."
10935,64489,"If you are handing it to them, it is considered exceptionally rude to do it if you don't have one for everyone in your department or office workspace.  

My fiance is inviting his whole office (a whopping 4 guys!) and will be handing out his invites.  I work in a much larger office.  I asked each person individually for their address and will mail the invitation to them."
10760,53299,"My fiance and I chose the DC area. We chose this because our immediate family is all there, even though we aren't. Most of the wedding party and the guests will have to travel, but we figured they arent going to have a bad time i.e. our wedding and DC."
10958,53299,"Why don't you offer to plan most of the wedding for her. If she is not into the whole planning thing then this is a way for you to get really involved in your wedding. If you do not feel comfortable doing this then hire a planner that both you and your fiance feel very at ease with so that they can do most of the work and both of you can relax and enjoy your engagement!

to help those operating on a tight budget (like we were) we offer the ability to choose how your final products are produced.  after purchasing a design and layout, you can choose to have the artwork printed on your own (staples, kinkos, etc) or purchase the final product on our online store.

11006,53299,"This is pretty simple here is an example of a married couple:

Mr. and Mrs. John Smith
4501 Smith Road
Smith, Virginia 55555

For the inner envelope you can put John and Jane Smith, John and Jane, Aunt Jane and Uncle John, Grandma Jane and Grandpa John, or if they have kids you would put them in the inner envelope also. Just remember that children over tha age of 18 living in the same household recieve their own invites!

If you want to invite a single person with a guest you simply do this:

Mr. John Smith
4501 Smith Road

At first, I had massive guilt for saying no (even though everyone kept telling me it wasn't our responsibility).  BUT.  Over the past 6 months or so there have been SO MANY people who expect us to help them out that I've sort of gotten over it.  We have family all over the country so no matter what people were going to have to travel.  We simply cannot afford to finance airfare and lodging for all 30 of our guests!  It's been much easier to say no to everyone than to try to help out on a case-by-case basis and slowly going broke.  Like everyone keeps telling me, if they really want to get there, they will.  It's not your or your fiancé's responsibility - no matter how much they whine!  Hang in there."
10967,59942,"I agree as well. I've seen several red, black and white weddings (mostly in the evening) and they are very elegant. "
10504,37874,"Meet with them. Listen to and take a good look at their sound systems. Is it nice looking and well maintained? How is the sound quality?

Check out their temperament and communication skills both on and off the mic. It takes a bit of legwork but is well worth it and will help you decide who is best for you.

9896,37874,"An iPod cannot read a crowd, constantly monitor and adjust volume or perform a seamless beat mix that sends the party to another level. Unless you get a very high end iPod mixer or use 2 iPods, there will be gaps of silence between songs. And someone has to run the thing. While they are doing that, they can't enjoy your reception.

A Pro DJ has learned to set aside his personal music likes and play to the crowd. He has learned from experience what songs to play and how to build energetic sets of music. 

Uncle Charlie the iPod King, however, may decide that what y'all need is some Hank Williams right in the middle of a good set of Rock (or whatever) that has everyone dancing. Only when he hears the audible groan of your guests as they simultaneously leave the dance floor does he realize that he made a mistake.

And don't even get me started about coordinating and announcing! It takes a good 2 years of performing at weddings before a DJ/Emcee has mastered running one."

11004,26876,"Just ignore them, if they really wanted to go they will go. I know their going to be your inlaws an all, but your not suppose to beg anyone to go to your wedding no matter who they are. But, i have to agree with them trying to make a vacation. I wouldn't just want to go for a weekend, I might as well stay a little longer. Its not like they go to the carribbean everyday right? So if they decide to go longer than the weekend then who cares its their money and life, and they can decide what to do with it. Don't stress."

11053,26876,"Well I am not sure to make of it. You can't really say he is cheating on you, but you can accuse him of talking to another girl. Even if you had enough proof,You wouldn't look so well accusing him of cheating after you hacked into his email account. Your suppose to respect his privacy, and you didn't. Now I know you found these messages back and forth and it they might give you the impression of him cheating, but you don't know the whole story yet. I have a feeling that your relationship may take a wrong turn. Before you go lurking anymore into his privacy, maybe you need to sit down, tell him what you did, apologize for doing that, and then tell him what you found, because your not so innocent either if you hacked into his account. I wouldn't go any further with your investigation, because you'll only be compromising the relationship more so. Talk to him now, and if you don't get the response you want, then reconsider marrying him. TRUST and COMMUNICATION is KEY! "
11053,26876,"I ran out of room. I just want you to understand that in order for any kind of relationship to work there has to be trust and communication. I am pretty sure you know this, but are you execising it. I was in a sort of long distance relationship with my husband before we married, for 7 years. At first we may have seen each other once a month, if that. After we got our cars it was more like every Sat, still only once a week. There were some hard times, but the only thing that held us together was trust, communication, and of course love. Without that I wouldn't be married to him. So if you really love him and see yourself marrying him despite what you have read, talk to him now, and then you can decide what to do from there. I wish you best of luck, and hopefully its just nothing. "
11053,51708,"Well well well if it was I, I would think that my guys was doing a lil something on the side but you don't know the relationship that they have it could very well be just close friends I have friends that I call babe and send crazy emails to but we both know that there is nothing but friendship there. Plus you have to trust him! But don't be a fool either sometimes you have to trust your gut feeling!

11053,39625,"Don't attack too quickly. The fact that you hacked into his email, is strange to me....was he perhaps unfaithful before and you started to get that itch?
The girl who wrote the emails does not seem to know how to write full sentences or words either, so I didn't really understand.  What you could always do, is sign up for an account online somewhere using his email address, so that they send confirmation and other info to his account. This way you could just tell him ""Oh I signed up for something and had to use your email address...so could you sign into your account for me"" Have him sit there and do it, and as his inbox opens be calm and cool, and say who's that? See how he responds and go from there.
You should always trust your partner, but if your gut is telling you somethings wrong, it's most likely right.
Best of luck!"
11053,58465,"Let's start with the fact that you hacked into his email-  obviously, something wasn't feeling right which led you to be uncomfortable and take this action. And next, you say 'before I accuse him of something'-   why don't you just ASK rather than ACCUSE? you know?  If you approach it calmly, it can only help the situation. : )

And be prepared:  for the truth and for the fact that you will have to admit the hacking-  which is also not cool.... good luck.....
"
11041,39625,"That's actually a good question. Edible flowers such as violets, pansies and roses, must be grown pesticide-free. Nontoxic flowers may decorate a cake but must be removed before serving. Toxic flowers shouldn't be used on or near the cake.
When you visit your flower market, be sure to ask whether the flowers were grown pesticide-free or not. You can certainly use hydrangeas, just make sure they are also pesticide free.
Hope this helped!"
10865,63207,"silk flowers are so fine, and you could mix silk with real flowers also.
another tip i will give you is check your local supermarket. the florist in a supermarket is so much cheaper than a floral shop. and you could just pick out your flowers and make your own arrangements.also the florist could do a replica of something you saw in a book for less than half the price. as a planner I am always looking for ways to save my brides money.

We were new to eachother so I didn't know any different. I thought he was going to see family. He swears he didnt sleep with her. I found this out from getting into his email. There was nothing sexual but definitely a deep thing going on there. I printed out the emails and confronted him. He just cried. He apologized and begged me not to leave. I forgave him eventually but I don't trust him 100%. I'm just scared. I think I am going to wait until I see more emails. I'd be happier if I didnt see any. Hopefully this was just a friend.

10777,61177,"Susan,
I have always stood by the etiquette that it is not appropriate to request gifts or gift preferences. You should be inviting guests because you want them to be part of your day, not because they are bringing or you are assuming they are bringing a gift. For showers it is a little more acceptable and requests can be included with the invitation or spread the word by bridesmaids, mothers, etc. I would suggest coming up with another option besides a cash handout.  How about registering at a home improvement store (or passing the word that you would like gift cards) or how about registering for gifts for your honeymoon?  I know as a guest that I would be more comfortable with something a little more personal than ""bring me $50"".

10701,36661,"My wife and I took a Carnival cruise for our anniversary two weeks ago.

We visited Grand Cayman, Montego Bay, and Cozumel.  It was a great experience.  (We really enjoyed snorkeling and snuba in the Caymans and Cozumel in particular.)

Yes, there are a fair amount of kids on board.  However, you can avoid them during the days at sea by hanging out at the adult pool (plus they're usually in Camp Carnival all day anyway).  Food was high quality, and there's no shortage of things to do.  I would put the average age of the person on our cruise in their mid 30's.  It's not a booze cruise, but you'll have a good time on board.

You'll save money on excursions by booking them yourself.  The balcony cabins are worth it.  If you budget yourself about $100 per person per day, you'll have money left over at the end of the cruise after visiting the bar and buying photos.

If it's the right date and the right ports of call, I can't see how you wouldn't enjoy yourself on Carnival."

I have looked into the golden bull which seems nice because they have cakes, chapange for toats, plated meals are a little high but too bad and they also have a dance floor."
11104,54566,"I recommend looking locally. I just bought mine from someone on craigslist (still had the tags on it). Also, I know alot of ladies have bad experiences, but my second choice was David's bridal. If you can catch one on sale that is. Also, in case no one has told you, wedding dresses generally don't run true to size. SO if you wear a 16 you will probably need at least need a 18 if not a 20. And they can usually only be altered up or down one size from their origional size (and that's expensive. you may save on a dress adn then spend it all getting alterations) I would suggest going somewhere like David's Bridal and trying some on to get an idea fo what size you will need and what style looks best on you. 
Good Luck!! "

11084,56581,"I did a little research on this myself, and I decided against it. You have to get the butterflies overnighted and many of them can die in transit, so you have to order more than you anticipate, so it can get expensive. The other thing to consider is the impact on the environment. Although it looks beautiful, releasing non-native butterflies into a foreign environment is bad for the butterflies because they will most likely die soon or pose a danger to local species. But, if it is something that you want to do, just google it and you can find a vendor and compare prices.  "

11041,9398,"For some brides there is no substitute for real flowers. They look elegant and can be chosen to complement the flowers in the bride's bouquet. There are now special holders that are available to florists especially for creating cake decorations. This allows the decorations to be easily moved when it comes to the most important part - eating the cake! 

Some flowers are poisonous such as foxgloves (Digitalis) and Aconitum. Your florist will know which real flowers are safe to use on the cake. 

Artificial / silk flowers are a popular alternative. If you are worried that real flowers may affect the cake, these are another option. 

Edible wedding cake flowers made from icing sugar really put the cake makers skills to the test. I've seen incredible roses, alstromeria and calla lilies made from icing sugar. Capturing the color and shape of the flowers is a real skill but can produce absolutely stunning results that are extremely lifelike and completely edible.
"
10960,9398,"No. You should not pay gratuity for tasting.
But if you are still compelled to be thankful and polite in some way because of how attentive they were to your needs, let them know by thanking them for their service and complimenting them. If on the other hand you did not like the tasting, or your relationship with the caterer or baker, you can either say nothing and never go back, or let them know that they are not what you are looking for right off the bat. They might feel just as bad as if they have received a bad tip."
10088,9398,"There are many ways to cut down your wedding expenses without killing ""the vibe"". :)

1- Save Postage on Your Wedding Invitations - have guests reply by phone or online.
2- Change the Day of the Week - weekday weddings can be easily negotiated with vendors.
3- Save Money on Decorations - Have your cerimony and reception in the same place and decorate with candles instead of flowers. They can be romantic, gorgeous and inexpensive. (you can dress them up with hurricane glass for extra $)
4- Learn to Ask for Help to Save Money - Think of musicians you know, well-spoken friends who could be your officiant, and crafty people who can help you assemble things. They will generally be honored to be a special part of your big day. Also look for money-saving tips everywhere.
5- Do it Yourself - Throw a ""pitch-in party""; where the invite asks your friends to be a special part of your wedding by helping you assemble favors, make invitations, centerpieces, and other homemade touches."
10376,9398,"It sounds like this is your first time.I believe you don't know how tired you might be on your wedding day. If you want an informal wedding, it is great to have it early, but you can have a late wedding at a garden or park and make sure it is somewhat informal by the way your invitations look. They will give people a ""preview"" of what kind of wedding they might be attending.
I do not recommend the candlelight wedding at night. Your pictures might not come out as perfect if you cant afford a great good photographer.
We've done a candlelit wedding during the day for a 3pm wedding. It was gorgeous. The entire walkway was with candles, and since it was daylight and the church had big glass windows, it was light enough to produce beautiful pictures with a candle touch.
Around 5 pm the reception started with champagne and h'or dourvres. Then lots of pictures with everybody, party music and dinner. It was early enough for the bride/groom to get to their honeymoon hotel and enjoy the night"

I also agree with the comment that you were feeling like something was wrong.  Ladies we know when it's not right.  Yes you invaded his privacy but he is also being deceptive and you have a right to know what type of marriage you are getting yourself into.  If he is going behind your back...There is a serious problem.  I would ask him if there was anythign he wanted to talk to me about.  If there's anyone else?

11147,58712,"Hi Congratulations on your up-coming wedding. I have seen a cake cover in the LTD catalog I believe the web site is www.ltdcommodoties.com I saw them in there last year I am not sure how big they are but for a cake on the smaller side you should be OK with them. You could also try asking the bakery where you are purchasing the cake. Another idea is to make a netting it would be fairly cheap and you could make it very unique, for example use a circle wooden or metal hoop hang it from the ceiling and drape long sheets of tuel totally covering the top opening of the hoop with the tuel, I would suggest using white tuel and maybe attaching butterflies or small flowers that match your theme colors, to the tuel to give it a personal touch. When it's cake time you get to unveil your beautiful masterpiece for everyone to see. You might even want to add a few pieces of fishing string to pull and be able to raise the tuel completely away for the cake for cutting. Good luck! Missy "

The rehearsal was at 7pm and ended close to 10pm, and everyone was starving!!!! Even if you do not have a rehearsal dinner, consider providing light refreshments/snacks/finger foods.

11168,49399,"Hi.  The question you have presented does not have a right or wrong answer.  You simply have a need to come to a decision that works well for both of you.

Who is paying for the wedding?  Does your fiance's concern have to do with the budget?  That is a consideration; however, if that budget is not a concern you should find out what is.  Does he feel your wedding will be any less special?  Can you find a compromise?  Is the count something that will cause problems?  

You two need to sit down and have a conversation about his objections to the number and your reasons for needing to invite who you have placed on your list.  Once you both decide what is or is not important about the number of guests on the list, you should find your answer...together.

Good luck!

If you are considering blue as your accent color a few very beautiful flowers that would be in season during June are the Hydrangea and Iris.

Show your finance some pictures of something black and white (such as a checkerboard) and then show him how your vision and his vision can become one lovely picture! "

First is using a hat box that can be purchased at a craft store and decoupaging it with your favorite black & white (for a retro look) or color prints of you and your fiance to the the hat box. Make a slot in the top that would be large enough to place cards. To make it more unique stack 3 boxes on top of each other to resemble a wedding cake and add satin ribbon to each box for an added touch. Add a little elegance by placing beautiful cording and finish off with a tassel. The second idea would be is to use a simple treasure chest in a color to coordinate your wedding.

Just remember it's you wedding! Heard it before huh? Remember you need to be happy first, before everyone else!! There are things that I know I want at my wedding no matter what. Like, I'm having a photo booth, my mom doesn't want me to, but it's something I really really want. I also wanted cupcakes instead of a wedding cake, but my mom was heart broken when I told her I wasn't having a wedding cake, so finally I decided, okay, I'll let her have her cake. I guess what I'm saying is you have to decide what you REALLY REALLY want and what you could do without. And it's gonna be like this the whole time!! If you decide you don't want to do counceling, or you don't want to change the date again, you have to let your mom know. Just tell her you need certain things to be able to have the wedding of your dreams. Good Luck!! "

A couple of things to help cut the cost.

2. A day time wedding may be less expensive
3. November - February are the slow months for us, so I assume that they would be the slower months for the other vendors too.  We normally offer discounts during this time of year, even on Saturdays.

I had a bride who chose these colors and also included coral as an accent.  Her bridesmaids wore chocolate dresses with the turquoise ribbon and carried pincushion proteas for the bouquets.

10960,1552,"Hi JDR,

You do not need to tip your caterer/venue for the tasting.  However, it is not uncommon to tip the waiter/waitress who served your party during the tasting if this person was serving your table only.  This is usually in a hotel or other venue that has staff available and can reserve them away from a usual lunch or dinner hour for your tasting only.  Again, not necessary, but would be very considerate knowing they are not making tips at this time while hosting you away from the lunch crowd.

Good luck!

Everyone loved them, it was not expensive and it didn't take long and she got to use her favorite scent the fresh linen.

While your there ask how much decorations are allowed and then picture in your mind a paradise of covering up all the oldie stuff with big drapes of clothe hanging from the ceiling and candlelights from every table and don't foget the spotlight to shine your names up on the clothe. If it was me, just to have some peace I would say sure you save by having it in the hall, but the money I save would go into transforming that place into someplace totally gorgeous. And if it turns out that the place smells like old tennis and you can't decorate the way you want, I would have to say no.

  I had a church ceremony we don't dance either. So we played songs that me and my husband loved and we did alot of mingling. We also had people come up to the head table if they wanted to to give us their gifts. We had a few that were hand made, that was pretty cool. And we still did the garter but my pastor said do it respectfully, so I put the garter just above my ankle and surprised him with monogram stockings and our wedding date on the stockings. We had fun and people were so busy eating that they weren't bored. A wedding reception I did we had a game at the end, I stuck a heart under one chair at each table and whoever was sitting there got the center piece. Or like at the bridal shower how much do you know about the bride well you could say how much do you know about this couple and leave questions on each table for that table to answer then give some sort of prize.

Best Wishes

I think that you should take this opportunity to become even closer to your MIL by maybe taking her out to lunch or dinner, make it a girls day out and spend time with her, get to know her even more and that would give you the opportunity to thank her. I think that she would appreciate it more than a gift. THat way also your parents wont also get the wrong idea, regardless of who's helped the most, the more important thing to consider is whos supporting your decision to marry. My MIL is my second mother, she's been there for me always. She's meant so much to me, and I don't think a gift would be enough to repay all that she has done for me and my husband, all I know is that we both cherish or relationship. "

11188,4007,"Hmm a black wedding near Halloween....
Ok, so I'm not at all a fan of this color scheme, it is funereal at worst, and prom-ish at best. And, formal and black in the daylight hours, particularly out on the grass, is questionable.
Here's what I would recommend: chocolate brown, ivory, and the accent color of your choice with a mettallic accent (silver, gold, copper, or bronze, depending on your accent color.) Select the length, fabric type and color you'd like and then have your maids find a style in that color that is flattering to their body type. My linen rental source has some amazing new tabletop products that work in this palette, and there are many goregeous botanicals that could be used in your florals if you went with the brown.
"
11188,20989,"The great thing about black and white is how much you can dress it up or down.  It can cover the gamut from ultra-black tie, to Saturday afternoon chic.  So you absolutely can do black and white and have it be just the right amount of formal for your tastes and for what the time and location of the ceremony call for.

The trick is finding the dress, and even if it is a full length gown, it can still be less formal if it is a fun design.  You mentioned letting your BMs pick their own dresses, which is a nice thing to do, especially since your girl are a wide range of sizes.  You could find a sash to go with the dresses in a black and white pattern - stripes or polka dots.  That would keep it less formal, and tie everyone's look together.

Good luck with whatever your choose to do!"

I am a travel agent certified with multiple Cruise lines (including Carnival) and specializing in Honeymoon travel.  Each cruise and ship has it's own character/demographic group it appeals to.

Buy a roll of ribbon from any party store and a heart shaped hole puncher. Put the picture you have on this page on it and your wedding date, add from Mr. & Mrs. and a thank you for making this day great. No ordering and no extra hidden cost. And yes it is always good to give a favor if you invite people to a wedding.

Hope this helps,

11246,12320,"Since you guys are looking to have an outdoors wedding on a tight budget, maybe you should look into your local park. The scenery will be breath taking and it would fit your budget. You won't have to spend tons on decor or flowers because of your surroundings.Check with recreation and parks to reserve the date and a pavilion. You would have to rent seating and a few tables, but it is less costly than renting a hall or another venue.I hope this has been helpful. Congrats!"

11257,48212,"I think if its indicative of what your interest are, then go for it!
Remember that this is you and your hubby's day, and people remember the small things, the personal things. Besides, something like this would make your wedding memorable and if your future hubby loves it, you should def. let him have it. What you might want to do, if you think its tacky, is keep the camo to a minimum, for instance, instead of the vest, being camo, they can make the ties camo. And then you can have as center pieces Tree branches, with candles hanging from them? since you are getting married in September. That would give it a romantic and earthy feeling as well. 

Good luck and much happiness!"

It does not have to be grand.  It should actually be on a different scale then your wedding.  This is also the time to present your bridal party with their gifts as well as each other.  You also mentioned being tired and that sort of thing.  Consider having the rehersal 2 days prior to the wedding.  For example, if the wedding is on Saturday have the rehersal on Thursday.

We paid for airfare and the room (well, a guest paid for our honeymoon suite). We were able to eat and have fun on the cruise and when it docked in the different places it visited. 

It was nice to leave the cold weather and go somewhere nice and warm. Plus, with a cruise, you can make monthly payments before your big vacation. Nevertheless, whatever you decide to do, book your airfare now while it's still cheap and way before your honeymoon vacation.

I wish you the best of luck!

11151,39914,"This is a tough one because having a rehearsal dinner is a good time for everyone in the wedding party to get to know one another. Also, it is a good time to thank your wedding party for being a part of your special day. In a sense, people look forward to the event because it's a time for gathering a (free...lol) food. You don't have to have anything grand. Since your wedding is in August, you might even consider a bbq is the wedding rehearsal isn't too late. All in all, the rehearsal dinner doesn't have to be a grand event, however it might be nice to have something just to say thank you to all that are helping to make your day a special one. I hope this helps."

Also hot summer nights, outdoors, there will be bugs.... something to think about, good luck "
10508,67003,"I think this sounds like a great idea as well, unfortunately I do not think it is fair to your guests.  I think they would all like to see the ceremony, and if there is no ceremony you should not be expecting gifts from your guests.  I wanted to do something along these lines and was quickly told that it would not be fair to my guests, it would only create tention.  sorry"
11208,21407,"Even as a vendor, we have experienced that. It's too bad that people need to flame and bully others on the internet, under the guise of anonymity. It happens to us all, so even we have removed ourselves from most forums. Some vendors are just as bad with each other. I can't understand it. "
11260,21407,"Can you not compromise, and have the ceremony in the church, and your reception outside? Or ask him if a religious ceremony is so important to him, could you not incorporate that into the outside ceremony?  Have a backup plan though in case the weather is bad. A marquis (tent) would be a good consideration.  "
11282,21407,"Anything goes, and I think the navy would be gorgeous especially for an evening wedding. You can co-ordinate it with just about any colour of your choosing.

11261,64491,"Hi Mrs Attaway,
    Here's a crazy thought, why not hold it in the court yard of a church. Are there any churches in your area that would accomodate your guest count, and would allow you to use their courtyard? That is an easy fix. And if a man is religous, you don't want to mess that up, its always a good thing to have a man that is guided by his strong religous beliefs, because most religions say though shalt have only one wife.

Hope that helps,

11257,53299,"Personally I think camo is tacky for a wedding. But the color of camo are GREAT for a wedding. How about you use the copper and greens as your colors and have the guys in  forest green ties/vests anf have the girls in the copper/bronze dress that you wanted for them originally. Them if you still want to incorporate camo, maybe you can do it in little touches here and there: in the bouts, in the bouquets and the centerpieces somehow. Use it, but do not over use it. "

It's the best friendship I have ever had with another human being (other than my fiance, of course)."" AMAZING trumps never incredibly close in my book...

11206,48751,"I definitely agree on the spending time together idea.  It sounds like she really cares about you, so she would probably appreciate a ""Girls Day Out"" instead of a gift.  One thing that all my sisters and I did for our weddings was to invite the MIL to get manicures and pedicures with us before the wedding.  It was a great bonding time with Champagne (or Sparkling Cider) and Desserts-we basically took over the salon.  DEFINITELY get her flowers for the Big Day, either a small bouquet or a corsage.

For one of sisters, the MIL did not want to have extended family, so my Grandmother had a seperate dinner for them after the dinner at the church.  "
11286,56581,"I've heard the general rule that for every 50 guests, you should have one BM and one GM. Really, you just want to balance the size of your bridal party with the style/formality/mood and size of your wedding. Small weddings would look weird with a large bridal party and a bigger guest list would make a small bridal party seem awkward. And the more people in the bridal party, the more formal the event will look/feel... Also keep in mind your budget. The more people you have in the bridal party, the more your flowers will costs..."

Maybe you could even find church pews to set up in the park.  Taht would give it the feel of church being outside.  As long as the ceremony is short, it should be fine outside, but I would DEFINITELY suggest moving INSIDE for the reception, especially if you're dancing."

We ended up inviting about 400 and had about 350 in attendance.  There were probably at least 30-40 people who didn't ""need"" to be there.  So just be careful with your guest selection, and don't limit your list to a certain number yet, there will probebly be several people who can't make it.

I would suggest breaking with tradition for this one, she can still be your MOH for the ceremony, but maybe not in the planning.

If it is going to be a problem, maybe choose a nice green to compliment the bridesmaids dresses for the groomsmen and they can wear full-on camo for the rehearsal.

More worried about a bridal shower then you are about having someone that means a lot to you standing next to you up at the alter. She is 15 and not ready to handle planning parties and whatever else it is you think a maid of honor is responsible for. To me the point having the people in your wedding is because they are the people that mean the most to you and who you want to be with you on that special day. Not people you can tell what to do. The only duties I feel your MOH or bridesmaids should probably take care of for you would be a shower. Since your MOH is young the bridesmaids should be apart of it. I dont know a single MOH that has planned the shower on their own. They have either had the bridesmaids helping or the mother of the bride.

I have a bride who is having a December wedding and her colors are black and white with red accents and it's going to be beautiful.  Her wedding is more formal, it's after 5, but as someone suggested, put the girls in tea-length dresses.  That will lighten the occasion.  And pick an accent color and throw it in the mix. "
10865,62458,"I offer brides a choice of silk or fresh.  I've found lately that more and more people are going with the silk florals.  It's good because going silk means that  you can have whatever flowers you want.  You don't have to worry about the extra expense of something that's not in season or something that's exotic, etc.  Just make sure that your floral designer is using high quality silk flowers.  You want them to have the look of real flowers even though they're not. "
11316,63871,"I am doing long stem crystal roses because I am trying to have sort of a rose theme. They come in a box and have tags on the box that I can have personalized. It is always a good idea to get favors that you can have personalized with your names and the date of the wedding so that it is memorable to your guest. I posted some links below of some sites that I went through. The favor warehouse had a few nice and inexpensive things. I would suggest that if you have any type of theme for your wedding, wedding party, or even ceremony, to have your favors represent that as well. Good luck!

I like to suggest things that can be useful, I've had too many wedding favors that I keep for sentimentality and end up taking to the thrift store or trashing them a few years later.  I actually went to a party where they had used my cookie cutter favor to make cookies, it was so exciting!  But it's definitely NOT required.  If you aren't giving them out, simply say a verbal ""Thank You"" at the reception.  I can get you the information for all three if you'd like.  Contact me through my vendors page."

11246,67476,"Hello!  There are tons of other things you can do to save money, too.  For example, don't serve an entire meal, but do a fun dessert only reception or appetizer only reception.  Just don't plan these around meal times, but more like early/late afternoon.  I went to a lovely wedding where it was a church ceremony, and then in the church's hall (most will have some kind of hall) they had tons and tons of desserts with coffees,teas, and hot chocolates and soft drinks set up and it was more mingle and eat style (a few tables and chairs, but a lot of those tall little tables people could stand and talk at).  Another couple's wedding I went to had a lovely ceremony set up in the park where the guests all sat on blankets the couple had set out, then had a couple of tables set up with trader joe's foods and a cake set up and it was really nice (again, in the afternoon).  One piece of advice: don't cut on the photographer!

10865,60648,"Thanks everyone for the responses.  I am having issues not only finding someone who is available to do my flowers on my wedding date and also someone who will do it in my budget.  They are mostly telling me that silk is more expensive because they use a top quality silk flower.  So my question is what is an appropriate amount for florals?  I am not doing centerpieces or a while lot decor wise.  I need a bridal bouquet, 7 BM bouquets, 11 bouts, a toss bouquet, and maybe a little something for the arch and the guest book table (nothing big or extravagant).  Any help with this would be appreciated since I have no knowledge of flowers, real or silk.  Thanks!"
11321,48751,"I dont think couples need two crystal roses.  You could give them out with the placecards, that way you would only need to do one per couple.  Either that or put them at the tables-maybe use them as part of the centerpiece and put a note that's  something like ""as a thank you, Tiffany and Husband would like to you have this crystal rose.""  Another option, If you're doing a receiving line at the Ceremony or Reception, you could personally pass them out-but have some extras for later in the evening in case anyone whines that they didn't get one.  What a lovely favor.  "

On the part of the photographer, you can find a 'portfolio shooter' for very little.

There are plenty of digital photographers out with cameras these days. Literally thousands in every city.

If you look carefully, you can find a very adept artist who needs to build a portfolio and will take a wedding for little or nothing.
Keep in mind that when you spend very little, the photographer wont be able to include much product with the package.
Often, a portfolio shooter will burn a disk(s) for you of the wedding.

Beware of 'friend of the family' shooters who just happen to own a camera. Many weddings get burned because of these guys have a camera, but dont know what it takes to shoot a wedding.

Go with the portfolio artist before going with the infamous 'Uncle Bob'"

I guess I go against the grain.

I am a wedding photographer in St. Louis, and the first thing I do at the reception is make a B-Line for the music presentation.
This is the person who will be helping coordinate your reception schedule as well as the music. 
As an artist, I love arriving at a reception and finding a saxaphone, guitar, keyboard/synth, microphones, and a band of guys who have been creating art for years.
...makes for great photography too.

they have their equipment set up so that they can turn the volume down for any individual instrument...or the master volume as well.

The trick is finding a band with your selection of songs.

I love the bands, on the other hand the DJ has a billion songs and CD's that he can pop into the player....."

11331,49399,"Hello, Celeste.  Who does your fiance have serving as groomsmen? Is there a reason his only brother is not serving as a groomsman or usher?  

Now for suggestions, as you requested. You can have your future in-laws say some words of encouragement or a blessing (not necessarily religious) as part of the ceremony.  Your future sister-in-law (or brother-in-law as well) can read a poem as part of the ceremony.  You may also ask if they have something special they would like to write themselves and contribute.

You can include candle lighting and have them light the candle for their son, your mother lights your candle and you both light the unity candle.

Your in-laws can escort their son down the aisle, wait for your brother to bring you down and express that they are welcoming you into the family.

Just a couple of ideas to help you think about what may work for you.

Good luck!

11316,39625,"Well we are having three different favors:
For our wedding in Cincinnati, since everyones from out of town we are having welcome baskets delivered to each room filled with goodies Cincinnati's known for + water.
For our garden reception we are giving guests mini boxes filled with different flavors of Turkish delight.
And for out Canada wedding, my fiancé and I, got each couple/adult over 18 (legal drinking age in Canada) their own demi-bottle of Mumm's Champagne."
11316,26876,"I did personalized wine bottles, it was a bit pricey but I think people really enjoyed it, thats if they haven't drank it yet. I also bought mini wine glasses from Michaels and put mints in them at each table setting. I bought a thin b/w polka dot ribbon to tie around the stem of the glass and mini thank you tags. It was so cute! "
11322,26876,"I agree with you and I am glad someone else thinks so as well. My girls were so delighted to be in my wedding, and even said thank you afterwards for not being a total B*tch. I guess knowing me they thought they were in for a wild ride."

11286,67038,"THANX FOR YOUR RESPONSES THEY REALLY HELPED ME 
"
10848,62210,"I can see how you are excited, but in a way i am WAY nervous.  Just the fact of being in front of all the people. I can't wait to be married its just the planning that i have no clue about planning a wedding that kind of stresses a person out.. Good Luck to ya.. "
11346,67037,"I'm so sorry to hear about your situation! With a destination Wedding things get *SO* expensive.  Well, you still have two months to go.  Is there anything you can cut costs on?  Since it's a destinaion wedding perhaps you offered to pay for some of your guest to attend?  I mean, any friend or family member would really understnd if you couldn't cover their room fee's.  Is there anything you can cancel? Like the flowers - do a single stem flower for a natural and classic look -- 

Perhaps you can change the menu for the reception to cut costs, like insted of open bar have a paid bar.

Without knowing what your plans are it's hard to make suggestions, I'm just kind of throwing things out there.

Another thing you can usually do is move the wedding to a later date.  A simple notecard out to your invited guests can inform them of the change in date and I'm sure everything else can be moved and this way you don't lose anything you really want. "
11341,67037,"You can do a deep red butoneer for him and white ones for the groomsmen.  Another thing is the choice in jackets for the men.  Have the groom in tails - Or the best man can wear a white tux instead so that he stands out and creates a clear separations between groom and groomsmen.  I love your choice of colors :)"
11348,32212,"I completely understand the feeling! What I did was took a minute and closed my eyes. Tried to envision what I wanted my wedding to be like. Fantasize for a while and write down everything you want to see. Where are you at? What colors are everyone wearing? What does your dress look like? Where's the reception? How is the place decorated? What are people eating? ETC. Once you have your list, start putting things together. Once you start to buy things, you will have a pretty good flow going. Just make sure you deal with the big things first like booking a venue. Good luck!!"
11356,50366,"Hi, I am DJ so I have a lot of experience with this.  ""Normally"" you and your new husband have the first dance by yourself.  You could have someone cut in if you would like, especially if it is a particularly long song.  But, ""Normally"" you have your first dance and THEN you have a father-daughter dance and a mother-son dance.  You can also have instead of those 2 dances a ""parent dance""  You would have the DJ invite your father to dance with you and then about 1/3 of the way through invite the groom and his mother to join you, then you can even go one step further and about 2/3 of the way through the song, you can invite all your guests to join you on the dance floor.  Then you have a ""instant"" full dance floor.  I would suggest if you do do the last option to have another slow dance right after that so that your guests can continue to have a nice dance then, turn it up a notch with a faster song.  

Hope this helps.  But ultimately, anything goes these days - Good Luck!"
11316,50366,"We are having a Autumn wedding in Virginia.  So we are having mini bottles of Virginia sparkling cider with a nice burgandy bow (to match our color scheme and thank you card attached. 

It is sometimes nice to have a ""regional"" favor, something that is apart of where you live or grew up.  If you lived in Memphis, you may want to give little bottles of BBQ sauce.  Actually, BBQ sauce would be fun anywhere you live, and most locals have BBQ from their city or state.  It is also good to give something that is somewhat useful, not something that is going to be thrown int he bottom of a drawer.

A good friend of mine is kind enough to also be making chocolate lollipops in the shape of autumn leaves.  I will put a ribbon on each and have them tucked into the napkins at each place setting.

I don't expect much from my daughter because of her age.  I just chose her, because she is my closest and dearest female relative, and want her to be by my side when I marry my husband.

I would agree with a prior poster and ""team"" her with another ""older"" attendent, that way she won't feel like she is all alone in this and will be gently guided.  If she still is not interested, so what?  You can have another bridesmaid do the types of things that you are looking for, in fact divy up the responsibilities and everyone will have a good time, and not feel like it is a burden.

I would not have her step down...she IS only 15 and she really has no clue that she is behaving in such a way that is causing you stress.  

Hope this helps, and good luck, I know you will be able to work it out "
11341,26876,"WE did the same thing. My husband wore a white tux with red vest and tie, the guys wore the black with the red. I had a white dress with red so my husband and I matched. You can check my pictures on my profile and website so that you know how it looked. I think tha combo is great, very sophisticated and romantic, also gives you a formal look without spending an arm and a leg."
11348,26876,"Not everyone who gets married knows exactly what to do, it sorta just comes to them. I think that you should get your venues first, most places get booked 1+years in advance, so get that done ASAP! Then along with that compile a rough guest list, I say rough because you will go through it over and over until you actually send the invites. It does seem like a lot, only because its is, your wedding is in september and we're in march so yes you have a lot to get done, sorry to remind you. See if you can have your mom or fiance's mom help you too. Or maybe if you can afford it have a wedding planner help you out. "
11356,26876,"What we did is that we danced first and right about 1/3 in the DJ switched the song to a fast Merengue song to get the part started, it was really unexpected for the guests, they loved it though and it got them going. After a few fast songs, the DJ put my father daughter song on which of course my crowd quickly cleared the floor because they dont like slow and especially country(I had the""I loved her first"" song). My dad and I danced to that. "

I tried to explain to him that we need an est. of how much people will be contributing so we know how much we need to have, but people who have never had a big wedding don't understand!

11346,67772,"(sorry ran out of space...c my first response b/c this is cont from there) after the wedding we are going to continue to save like we have been for the wedding & pay off the credit cards.  My other option is asking my mom's best friend or my uncle for a loan 4 what we don't have by the date.  Don't worry, everything will work & you can find lots of ways to save money.  Here are some things I'm doing:
~get an ammeture/less experienced videographer & /or photographer, maybe even a film student (they charge less!), or if your okay with it, have a friend shoot photos 4 free!
~(if possible) BYOB or do a limited bar
~do your own flowers, centerpieces, decor, etc. - the only thing i'm paying to get done are the boutineers for the guys, check out www.save-on-crafts.com for unique ideas & CHEAP vases!

There is a lot involved in wedding planning; the only real thing you can do to make it easier is to hire a wedding planner; otherwise, you jump in and get started. As the other poster said- you usually start with the guest list and venue.

I would read up on how to get started and then, get started!  (there might be more info on some of the bigger sites like wedding channel and knot)  good luck"
11348,67772,"I suggest getting a wedding planning book, they sell them in bookstores..or for the cheaper route, use the checklist this site provides or they have good ones on theknot.com & brides.com too! The major thigns right now are decide on a theme & color scheme, decide on a budget that won't break u, find & book a reception site ASAP, find & book a ceremony site ASAP, go shopping & find your dress. Once you get those major things done, then get the BM dresses, book vendors for other stuff - flowers, photog, video, cake, DJ, transportation, etc; make or buy & send invites; do your registry (at least 4-6 months out); buy wedding bands; book your honeymoon; pick out guest favors.

11348,64266,"Planning a wedding can be overwelming with all the choices you have to make... Start with a list of things to do...for example I would start first with who is coming to your wedding. You will end up making several list...start with the most important guest and then go from there...  How many in the wedding party and so forth.  Then look for where to have your wedding...Go online in your state and check out who is offering what....get some suggestions from your friends and family...weddingwire has some good ideas

Keep your list and all your receipts in a folder thoughout the process.

If you are having a wedding of more than 100 guest I would hire a wedding planner..they do the work for you an its well worth it...

It was 92 degreeze in Cleve. that day but a slight breeze in the gazebo, it was awesome.  I think you're going to regret your wedding day if you don't have it outdoors."

11331,67943,"Hi Celeste.  This can be tricky.  I understand your dilemma.  For our wedding we had the parents both stand at the beginning of the welcome from the pastor and they took an oath to support us in our marriage.  We also had a part where both of us gave our mothers a rose.  In addition, I went to a wedding where instead of a candle lighting ceremony, they did a sand one.  The parents poured sand- dad was yellow, mom of groom was blue and poured it into the grooms glass making it green.  Parents for the bride did the same and made hers purple.  Then the groom and bride took turns pouring theirs into a joint glass.  It became layered with green then purple then green, it was really neat.  They also still have it and it is really cute.

You could also ask the sister and brother to say something nice like a passage from the Bible or a poem as previously mentioned.  You could also ask them to decorate the car and be in charge of that?  

I hope that this helps!"
11305,67943,"Maybe I am the only one on this that can encourage you, but you picked someone who means a lot to you and so keep her as your MOH.  Why not, screw the age.  However, she may be reluctant to help a lot because she doesn't know what she is doing and this means that you are going to start a new chapter, aka, she is losing her best friend.  For a 15 year old that is the world.  I would try just hanging with her and do something she likes, don't talk about wedding stuff, just spend some time with her.  Then the next time, explain, you did something with her and now she needs to help you this time for the wedding.  If she loves myspace, start slow with having her add a wedding countdown to your profile.  
Also you can have her create your knot.com profile for you and your guy.  Maybe ask her what her favorite foods are that you could incorporate at the bridal shower.  You could also get her to do things with you like put together favors by promising something like a bribe.Hope this helps!"

If a home reception or otherwise differing you can look for ice scultputres online, 411 or ask the cateer. I know of a few that are very good and reasonable."

11151,55641,"Like everyone else has said, it is not a requirement. But I think you should still do something, even if everyone just goes to someone's home for drinks and snacks afterwards. Part of the idea behind the rehearsal dinner is to give the bride and groom a chance to spend time everyone who is close to them in a more intimate setting than what it might be at the wedding. If you are having a very small intimate wedding though, that may be unneccessary."
11348,55641,"The checklist on this site is a great place to start. Try to focus on only the things that it says you need to take care of so you will not get overwhelmed.

Good Luck!"
11346,55641,"It might be possible to contact the vendors you have put down deposits with and find out if you can make adjustments to what they are doing for you. Then you could apply the money you have already spent to the new services.

Example: You were originally spending $1000 total on flowers, and have put down $500. Call florist and see what you can change to make your total closer to $500.

That could help you avoid having to lose money by rescheduling or going way into debt. I believe a vendor would rather work with you to make adjustments then lose your business entirely.

Good luck to you! Everything will turn out ok. Remember that in the end what is important is the marriage, not the wedding :)"
11261,55641,"Marriage is about compromise, and now is the best time to learn how to do that with each other.

I am in a similar situation, FH is religious and I am not. Our compromise is that we will have a religious ceremony but not in a church."

Take another zip-loc and position it inside your shoe, under the straps, etc. where your foot goes and fill it with water and seal the bag. Do this for both shoes and place each in yet another zip-loc, probably a larger one. Put your shoes in your freezer and let the water turn to ice. Leave it like this for a few hours, remove the shoes from the freezer and allow to melt (in a sink works best). Once you remove the zip-locs, the ice would have gently stretched your shoes to be more comfortable!"

It's one thing for the bride to ask her bridesmaids for assistance with planning, it's another thing to expect your wedding to take over all their free time."
11399,56581,"If he is a guy's guy, then his idea of nice and your idea of nice are probably pretty different. In my experience, guy's guys like things that they can share with other guys, like a nice BBQ grill or video game system, or even a day of paint balling. Definitely ask your daughter if there is anything she thinks he would like if you can't think of something."

Their press is bigger so they are doing stds, invitations and thank notes all on one sheet and then they'll cut it down.

11261,39625,"Hi,
I was actually reading what you wrote, and it came to me. I'm unsure of where you're doing the wedding and where the family reunion will be.  But have you ever considered having your wedding on the Saturday and the reunion on the Sunday? So that the guests at the wedding don't have to rush off and leave, they can join in on the reunion fun. I'm sure if you spoke to his mother and suggested something like this she may be all for it. In my culture (half Lebanese/half Turkish) we celebrate for three days! The first day is the day before the wedding, all the aunt and cousins come over, there's food and such. The second day is the church wedding and reception, and the third day is like a big bbq party at the parents home. So the family reunion would be like a continued relaxed celebration of joining family!
Good Luck!"

I would tell her that you discussed it with your fiance after crunching some numbers, however having another bridesmaid stretches your budget & you simply can't afford it. And it's true... weddings are expensive. 
Then I would invite her to help you w/ other details like passing out the programs if she still wants to participate... after all, it's not about her... it's about YOU!!  It's your day, and believe me it's going to be a stressful day. You want people there who are going to support you.

It's your wedding, not her's. =)"
11302,18635,"I think the idea of the sand ceremony is a good choice.  A previous post said the flame is one and the sand is individuals.  True but when you look at the sand(each a different color)you see the sand combined.  Each of you have different personalities and the sand represents you. The sand is mixed but it would be almost impossible to pick and seperate each color once combined.  You're individuals combined as one.  Make sense?  Plus the sand vase will make a beautiful addition to your home.  Something to represent your lives together.  Hope it helps."

11481,26876,"Its sort of an expected thing nowadays. Its also a nice gesture to your guest besides the food and drinks. You don't have to give out expensives gifts even if its like a personalized chocolate bar thats fine, and you don't have to give each person one, maybe per family sort of thing. Thats what I did, but I gave out personalized wine bottles. It was pricey, but it was my choice of favor. I also had minature wine glasses and stuffed it with some mints wrapped in tulle, that wasn't expensive at all, maybe $30 tops for about 100 guests. So consider doing something simple for each guest or a something per family."
11481,39625,"Well this is a good question. Favors are normally the bride and grooms way of saying thank you to guests. You don't have to provide one, but don't you think it would be a nice gesture, especially if guests are traveling and such. You can always find something very inexpensive and give it to couples and single adults over 18.  Or you can make your own favors.
I once went to a wedding where the bridesmaids had spend the week before baking earl grey tea cookies, and boxed them. 3 per guest. (It was the gift to the bride and groom from the girls) Perhaps you have a special cookie recipe of some sort? Or maybe this will inspire you to do something of your own. Another inexpensive way to go is a candy bar. Guests fill up boxes or bags with candy, you may want to look into that."

11481,61591,"Don't stress about favors, especially if you're having a big wedding. I've seen a lot of people make a donation to a charity in their guests' honor instead of favors. At each place setting, just put a small printed card stating something like, ""In lieu of favors a donation has been made in your honor to the American Cancer Society."" Or whatever you want. You could tribute it to a relative or special friend that has passed. Everyone will appreciate and admire that. And no one needs to know how much you donated. It's a great way to save money and do something nice. "

that all depends on what kind of budget you are working with and what kind of statement or ""theme"" your wedding reception is based upon....for 300 guests that can get kind of pricey, however, you can do that very affordably, like another poster said, such as in the area of a donation, etc.......nowadays, wedding favors are not mandatory....trust me....ppl will take the table linens if they could....

11481,60598,"First of all, with weddings now and how custom they are becoming please know that you don't ""have"" to do anything. It's YOUR wedding, so feel free to make it what you want it to be.

Regarding Favors. Let's first think about why favors are given. Favors are given to the guest as a sign for thanking them for their time, traveling to be with you on your special day, a token to remember you two by, a small gift for being one of the chosen guests on the biggest day of your life, and merely a symbol of thankfulness. If you are thinking about eliminating the favors because they are just annoying you, your not sure why you need to give your guests a gift or simply you just don't want to then I would think about why you are feeling this way and try to reevaluate. However, if you are eliminating them due to being out of budget or another valid reason then by all means get rid of them. I am a fan of donating to a charity in lieu of favors. It would be giving back to someone who really needs it"

First of all, I want to point out that if we all look around the old rules are not really in play.
The bride and groom is the ""queen & King"" and gets to say in this court. 
If the two of you only desire 1 flowergirl or 3 it's your wedding.
Wheather you want your sister, your bestfriends and your first cousin as well as your sister-inlaw to be as bridesmaids that is your choice as well. So Groom you can choose to match pair to pair.

You can also just have a witness for each side. one ~ one

Among the above weddings we have done a wedding that had more bridesmaids then groomen. When walking down the isle they just alternated paired single paired single.....etc....

You see there is no real rule, it is up to your heart.  Congratulations"

I have them in white, but I can get them in almost any color.  I had a bride use them and she and her husband signed and dated the back of each one.  So it was something personal and useful.  Your guests can put them on their refrigerator and remember your Day."
11481,52913,"Favors are a nice gesture of saying ""thanks"" to your family, friends, and guests for taking time to share in your special day. Favors are becoming a business in itself as people are looking to spare no expense in treating their guests to special trinkets and personalized items of the special day.
To stay within budget when accomodating a large wedding,treat your guests to other inexpensive options such as special baked treats including personalized cookies, candies, and cupcakes. A popular treat today is the candy bar---have a wide variety of candies that guests can fill in boxes or bags. Magnets or notecards with you and your groom's picture(s) on them are also creative and inexpensive!
I hope you are inspired to let your family and friends know how much they are appreciated!"
11481,58465,"I say:  if you can't find something relevant, something you feel strongly about:  don't do it.  I am not doing favors.  I came up with a few ideas and 3 people who are consulting me about the wedding advised against just ""coming up with SOMETHING to give out""  and I ultimately agreed. "
11502,26876,"Whats the reason for the fighting? Are they fighting over ideas, over you two getting married, or what? I think that this would be some good time to take some time out and evaluate the situation. Whats more important for you right now, is it the wedding, is it  getting married or having some peace and quiet? There isan't much that can be said being the information you have provided its kinda hard to know whats exactly is going on. I would just maybe continue on with the planning and ignore the people who are causing the trouble, the least amount of attention they get from you, the more likely they are to stop and wonder whats going on. You don't want to feed more to the fire, by being upset and arguing back. If you leave it alone, the fire will put itself out eventually. As the day approaches and nothing has changed, you can just go ahead without them. They'll figure out why sooner or later. "

1095,69406,"yes, ours is going to be expensive too but it was all about location.  i am getting married at a big resort on the jersey shore and it is costing us $2500 in fees alone...  (we chose the resort so we would have a PLAN B in case it rained).  we are having a lot more people than you are, but our ""cheap beach"" wedding is now $25,000 (and thats just a beach BBQ menu!).  i feel your pain!

where were you looking at?  were you going to do it at a resort on the beach or possibly just rent everything?  (tables, chairs, etc)

11260,69470,"Like many of the other posters, I would have to say that compromising on your wedding location will be a good idea. Having the church pews outside is an excellent idea! Or better yet, have your pictures taken outside to chronicle the event leading to the indoor wedding. What's most important is that you and your fiance are beginning a life together. How you handle this situation will be a sign of years to come. Also, please keep your guests in mind as well. I'm sure they would much appreciate an indoor wedding in Texas. :)

10758,69470,"Vases are a wonderful way to decorate your reception tables. Flowers are a good idea, but you could also fill the base of the vase with decorative stones (I found some at the Dollar Store!) and then set a single rose and babies breath on top of the stones. OR, you could set a water-activated LED light in the bottom of the vase, fill it with water and add a drop of red food coloring to the water. (mixing red and a blue LED light makes an elegant purple color - so if that works with your decor, go for it!) You can find LED lights on www.WeddingDecorPlus.com

11481,69470,"Favors are a wonderful way to thank your guests for sharing your special day with you and your husband-to-be. But, if wedding favors will break your budget or cause some feelings of resentment, then don't do it. You could, however, cleverly disguise some decor item for your reception as a favor if you feel inclined to give a a little something. A very good friend of mine used wine glass charms as a favor and and used them to dress up the glasses quite nicely. Because most guest didn't take the charms, my friend re-uses them when she entertains!

11517,26876,"I'd suggest using the wedding wire planning tools here. I personally didn't but thats because I found this site after i got married. Looks like you might have all the major stuff down. Do you have a theme or color scheme? Flowers? Invitations? Dresses? Favors? Wedding accessories such as guest book, unity candles if any? What about photography, music?

Once you have decided your colors and flowers a lot of it should fall in place from there. Will you be having the reception near a house or a barn? That could help in determining your choices as well. You could do a theme wedding, which many favor websites have many ideas to choose from. I hope that this helps, let me know if you need anything."
11524,26876,"I think the best way to handle it is give her a call and fore warn her about the boot, tell her that its imparative that she get in touch with you and that you feel there is lack of communication from her part and that with only a few months away its imparative that she get back to you or you will have to discontinue her services. Despite her being nice, you may have to be a little stern, afterall its not like she's working for you for free. A little harsh reminder may get her to act quickly. I hope it all works out for the better. "
11188,69652,"First I want to say,""Congrats"" on your big day.  First, remember that it is....Your Day :)  As far as weights and sizes, whatever type of dress that will compliement there body types will be the most flattering.  Being to formal?......It's a wedding!  As far as color choices, maybe me sharing this with you will help......15 years ago I certainly did not go very traditional.  My gown was made, and it was RED!  The brides mades were in black and white.  Their dresses were very elegant, and black and white.  We chose flowers to add some color.   So, will it look ""weird"" not if you have beautiful flowers, dresses that flatter, and go with the color scheme that is going to keep YOU  happy.  Best wishes."
5332,53086,"I would suggest going to Google and making sure you click on ""images"" not ""web"" and type in long wedding styles. ALSO another great idea I tell my clients is to look at red carpet styles. - google celeb hair styles and you should get a bunch of hits.  - Good luck!

5697,53086,"For my wedding I went to farmers market and bought Callalillys. I bought some thick/sheer ribbon and wrapped 3 stalks for my bridesmaids and 5 for me, I also did not do any flowers for the guys. For each mom and gramma I gave them 1 long stalk lilly. It was very eligant and unique, no corsages to polk in place!! then I got really tall slim vases from michaels and each bouquet was placed in a long vase on tables for decor for after the ceremony! 
Simple and pretty - and CHEAP!!!"
11527,56835,"what we did for my brothers wedding we got all the flowers to the hotel and stored them in the fridge we had but spary them with water so they are moist and don't dry out."
11539,26876,"I don't think you need to make a big speach about it or anything, I think you should be straight foreward with it and you don't even have to mention him in the conversation, its possible they may think your only asking because of your fiance if you say him and I would like for you to be in the wedding party. Afterall the girls are your business as the boys are his. Your already taking them out to dinner so just say something like ""I was thinking about who to include as my attendants and I have concluded that it would mean so much to me if you be mines."" I hope this helps."
11534,26876,"I think it all depends on what you have invisioned, also if your a religious person as well. It you want to get creative for your ceremony then probably a private venue would be better, I think the church would appreciate it if your ceremony was the least secular as possible, I don't blame them...I means its Church the house of God. So I think it all depends on you."
11527,26876,"I think it all depends on what kind of roses you are using, there are sooo many kinds of roses and some may bloom small other rather large. I had Black Magis roses(gorgeous!)and they can be rather big, so my bouquet had about 20 roses, I think a few more would have been perfect. It also depends on your size as well. I think a florist would be best to tell you how many you may need for your size. Also, if you make them the day before make sur you have enough room to put in fridge, Roses bloom better and faster in cold water. It also depends on the type of flowers you are using too. What kind of centerpieces are you having? Good Luck, you have a lot on your hands!!"
11403,38515,"I don't think you should feel bad for asking this. Being a MOH is a big responsibility and people shouldn't be so quick to judge. You don't want to miss out on help that you should be getting from your MOH. I would ask her if she still feels up to the task of being the MOH, and that if she would like to take that time to instead care for herself and not have to worry so much about the wedding, you would love for her to be a bridesmaid. I feel the MOH is not only a position of Honor, but of duty as well. The MOH is supposed to help plan things and do things for the wedding and that's why you put her in the position of MOH cause she's gonna be your right hand, and if she cannot be that helper, it might remove more stress from your life to find someone who can make that commitment. Good Luck!"
11188,56520,"My wedding is November 1st and I am doing the black and white as my main colors and red as an accent color. My BMs are wearing long black dresses, they too are all different sizes but they all look great in black. My fiance is wearing a white tux to match my white dress and then the groomsmen are wearing black tux's with red vest and white boutonnierres. BMs will have white flowers to break up the black a little bit, my flowers are red, and groom boutonnierre is red as well. So I think its a great idea to do the black and white, its very crisp, and your idea of picking a line and letting them choose is great too. I picked a color and let them pick whatever dress they wanted as long as it was appropriate. They all ended up with long dresses. Good luck and congrats!!!!"
11539,69375,"I agree with Christina, however...I would start by saying how much they mean to you and how happy you are that they will finally be ""family""! Butter them up...being a bridesmaid means work. Fun too, don't get me wrong, but many women see it as a hassle. So put a positive spin on it, butter them up, then say ""(insert fiance's name here) and I would LOVE to have you in the wedding as my bridesmaids.

Just my 2 cents! Good luck, and be thankful you're so close to his family! :)

It was a small wedding in August and she wanted roses, I went to a florist that was kind of like Sam's club everything came in bunches of 25 roses. Your answer is 25 roses with accent leaves and maybe some type of ribbon makes a full bouquet. You have to make it the night before spray them with water and put them in the fridge or you could buy the ones that have not blossomed yet and arrange them the way you want it, and stick them in water over night they come out gorgeous.

When your guests view your wedding website they have the option to sign your guest book.  They can go to the Guest Book page and click on ""Sign Guest Book.""

11517,60387,"Use your family's farm for part of the decorations. Are you getting married on a hill overlooking horse pastures? Or dairy cows grazing in their pastures.
Use the natural beauty around you. Do your folks have flower gardens, massive maple trees or evergreen trees, perhaps a small section of the lawn has a grape or rose arbor overhead.
That's what I would look for, natural beauty. Or you know, you could put up an arch, decorate with silk flowers, roses, etc., and you and your groom could get married under it with the preacher in front of you both.
On the tables, for centerpieces what about using wreaths of flowers with a angel fish in a vase in the center of each wreath, or just vases filled with flowers (domestic or wildflowers), picked from local gardens or in the fields,

"
11549,69470,"You've picked a beautiful location to get married. You will want to be sure that your guests are comfortable on the beach. If you are going for a more casual feel to your wedding, make this known on your invitations...something like ""Attire is beach-casual"". I would then make sure that flip flops are provided for each of your guests. We have some lovely <a href=""http://weddingdecorplus.weddingstar.com/4039-3+black+or+white+just+married+sandals"">""Just Married"" flip flops</a> on my wedding decor site that make an imprint in the sand as you walk! 

As for seating. I would stick with chairs versus beach blankets. This way it's not awkward for your female guests in dresses to sit and stand. 

A veil is not out of the question, but consider the wind when getting married on the beach. You don't want your veil to block your guests' view from seeing how beautiful you are on your wedding day!

Have the groomsmen wear black tuxs or suits with ""blood red"" vests but with black ties and their butonieres could be red. Your bridesmaids could have red and white flowers in their bouquets to coordinate with everyone.
Your fiance seems to like wearing dark colors so he would probably feel more comfortable in black, I think the ""blood red"" and black would really be a fantastic color combination."

11534,33513,"I get frustrated when I ask a ""this or that"" question and I get a bunch of answers that say ""whatever you want."" But, it's true. I can tell what type of ceremony is best for me, but that might not be best for you and your fiance. Are you religious? Is your fiance religious? Do either of you have a church that you frequent? Church weddings can be beautiful. formal, moving ceremonies but that is not dependent on the venue. Your wedding can be just as beautiful  and formal in a private setting. The better one is the one that is going to make you feel the most loved, beautiful, and happy husband & bride on your wedding day. "

11356,59126,"Typically the ""First Dance"" is for the Bride and Groom only, since it might be the only chance you will get during the evening to have a slow dance with each other.  If you want your other family members or guests to have the opporunity to cut into a dance, having a bridal party dance might be an option for you.  You will start the song off with the whole entire bridal party and a minute into the song have your DJ invite your guests to join in."
11403,70054,"I'd talk to her honestly about what she can handle. This happened to me at my first wedding - my best friend had her first baby 3 days... needless to say she could not be there physically much less participate. We decided a few months prior that in her interest she would take another role as a reader in the service instead. She didn't make it but her husband did & it was sweet. In my 2nd marriage wouldn't you know it but she's pregnant again - a week before the wedding date this time! So she again she isn't in the wedding... but her daughter (who was the first infant I am referring to) is now my flower girl.    "

11348,70056,"Hi bbbride!
I remember feeling so overwhelmed planning my wedding for 200+ guests.  All I can say is that checklists make it so much easier.  Then, just talked one list item at a time.  Looking up vendors online was a lifesaver for me.  Then I chose a few I wanted to know more about and met with them.  I see you already have a date, so you probably want to book venues first, them move on to other vendors.

10760,70165,"I would take your feelings as the main deciding point - choose a sentimental location, somewhere that was important to your relationship, a special place.
When I got married my husband and I chose the state where we met for college, even though neither of our families was from there. My family is from Brazil, so I knew most of them would not come. We ended up deciding on eloping, and it worked perfectly for us. :)

11524,57245,"First and foremost, attempt to contact all your vendors. Let them know what is going with your planner and you are double checking with all vendor to see if your wishes are being met. Second I would begin to look for another event planner(if you have a couple of months to spare)or not. Let them know what the problem is, tell them you already have everything in place and you need someone to overlook the entire wedding to make sure there are no disasters. You may be able to find new planner(just beginning)to do it for you at a cheaper price and guarantee they will do a better job then your planner, because they are looking for positive raves and other clients. "
11534,57245,"congratulations on your engagement;
I think you have already answer the question. It's appears that you are both not completely devoted to your religon.  On that note, look at your budget, if you budget can sustain a church wedding( few hundred for donations, decorations, candles, flowers,limo etc) and a ceremony somewhere else(also required rental payments, decorations,flowers, caterers,dj's,limo etc,etc) then I say have both is tradional. But if your budget is limited then having all of it in one place may be cost effective for you and your groom."

My mom has tons of flower gardens and I just talked to her about planting flowers with my colors. The yard is surrounded by huge oak trees and we are getting married in front of our old restored barn. I dont really have a theme. again thanks everyone for the help. I was honestly freaking out when I wrote my original post and thanks to the help of my family and your posts I am feeling a little less panicked:) I am still very open to suggestions."
9869,69976,"Looks like you have plenty of time before the ""Big Day"". I would suggest looking around and seeing for how much others can cater to you. A lot of the time, hotels put everything in a package deal, and make it sound real good...but for the flavor of the food served, you probably could have gotten it better and possibly cheaper elsewhere. 

It's definetly worth shopping around. Good Luck & congratulations!"

I think part of it is  you have to practice your technique so you know how to put it on right. 

Hope this helps"

I think, though, that my FMIL and I will go for manni-pedis and facials before the wedding, just the two of us, and of course, the rest of my in-laws will be thanked in my speech, but I plan on giving them more of my time, than the others, and most likely I will value their opinions more in the long run which, I think is the most valuable form of flattery.

11396,64491,"Tiffany,
Have you considered a mini bus and a limo? The limo will pick up you and your bridesmaids and the mini bus will get the groomsmen. After the ceremony the wedding party gets in the minibus and you and your new hubby ride in the limo to the reception. You can try ZBest in Glen Burnie, MD they have a variety of vehicles.

Best of Luck,

"
11546,56581,"I haven't seen this, but I have heard about it and read it in magazines and online: Try decorated hurricane lamps and candles or lanterns. The candle light will add a romantic quality to the ceremony if you can have low-lighting. If candles are a no-go, and you really do want to have flowers, have each bridesmaid carry a single long stem rose. It will beautiful, bold, and a lot cheaper than bouquets. I have also heard of bridesmaids holding baskets with flower petals in them (especially if you are not having a traditional flower girl), parasols, or fans. If there is anything that is significant to your and your fiance, like a book or photo, your bridesmaids could also carry these down the  aisle. Good luck! "
11557,56581,"One of my good friends is a make-up artist and will be doing my wedding day make-up. She has told me that if you are doing your own make up, go for whatever foundation your are most comfortable using. If you are going to a professional who uses airbrush regularly, go for that options. It is usually a little more expensive, but it looks amazing. If your make-up artist is not too familiar with using airbrushed make-up, your wedding day face is not her opportunity to practice a new technique. Either way, do a test run and see what you like."
11624,52913,"When you say ""bandanas"", I think of a scarf for your head or around the neck. It really depends on how the dresses are made. Bandanas are not long enough to use as belts, so you would probaly have to find some fabric that has the same look of a bandana. Your idea does not sound cheesy, matter of fact it seems very creative and ""out of the box""! Try the bandana idea out on your bridesmaids with the dresses that you are choosing and get a visual of how it will look. If that doesn't work maybe you can incorporate it in with you tablescapes or have the groomsmen wear them as hankies. 
CUTE IDEA TAYLOR!"
11527,68286,"have you thought about doing a mock before hand. You could even use fo flowers...

Rose will open if they are not put into the fridge.

"
10865,68286,"I am using silk flowers and have already done a mock one. If you would like to see a photo email me....Lizarragawedding@yahoo.com"
11527,12233,"That is a great idea, making a mock before the event. I know that the roses from the flower market do have thorns, so removing them is going to be such a pain! On another note: Does anyone have any (inexpensive) ideas for decorating a gazebo? I looked into a florist, but yikes! It would kill my budget! Anyway, does anyone know of maybe some sort of do-it-yourself book or website that I could use? Or any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for the ideas everyone!  "
11527,70653,"Tanya,  for a table arrangement 12 roses in a vase that is 6.5"" tall with an opening of 3"" to 4"" works great.  You would need to put them in warm water the day before so they will have a chance to open.  At my best friends wedding her colors were champaign and wine so we used a cream colored rose with a handful of glass pebbles in the bottom and a wine colored ribbon around the vase.  For you to carry, you want no more that 6"" of stem with them tight together and keep in mind that you will be holding them through the whole ceremony, wrap them with ribbon and use hat pins (they are a long straight pin with a pearl head) try and keep them in a row.  You will want to put it in the fridge over night to keep them from opening up any more.   "
11631,52913,"It seems like you have it all together! (GREAT!) Calla lilies are beautiful in any color but look at gerbera daisies and red tulips, too. Also, you can try to incorporate some green or white in with the bouquets and centerpieces to add a punch of color and to break up the red & black. There are also some tropical flowers that come in the color that you are requesting but it may not coordinate with the theme of your wedding. Just a few ideas!

11151,47365,"Thank you to all for your thoughts and/or suggestions.  Since the wedding is in August, I am leaning towards a cookout prior to rehearsal. Then we can rehearse and go home to rest.  I think I need the time to unwind and get ready for the next day.  Thanks again."
9649,47365,"Congratulations on your wedding. I too, am getting married in August.  My colors are ""pool"" blue and tangerine (a shade of orange).  The primary color is the blue and I am using the orange as an accent color in the flowers. Dark colors are also okay because the wedding is indoors. It's your wedding, do what you like!!"
11633,57245,"I would suggest a couple of things. First I would designate someone to make all phone calls to see who may or may not come to your wedding that one you have a rough idea. I would also give them a time frame for example to let you know by june if they are coming at that time begin making your phone and let them know that they are important to you but they need to let you know then if they are showing up and how many.  Giving them a couple of months to take off work,make flight arrangment etc is ample time.  Then you send your inviations giving you almost ten weeks for those you weren't sure if they were coming.  Sencondly, Send them an email or evite and have them RSVP by a certain time frams with yes and the how many people are showing up. You must asked them to make sure they included everyone that is coming in their party to your wedding.  Godd luck."
11517,57245,"hello and congratulations;
I know how fustrating it can be for you.  If you are getting marry at dusk used a lot of lighting(eg small x-mas lights clear) make everything look awesome at dawn. If you are getting marry in the early afternoon used subtle colors throughout your wedding/reception.  One more thing, go to a book store and grabbed a wedding planner they are very resourceful and lots of informations just look for the one that fits your wishes best. Good luck. "
11346,57245,"hello again, 
I know you had hire a destination planner and were having trouble with her returning your phone.  I suggest you read your contract (fine print) and if possible cancel her saving you some money there. Secondly, call vendors and see if you downsized on menu,flowers etc. And if you are extremely under budget then if possible cancel your destination wedding and tried for another in the city.  You may be able to used your parents farm(it seems that's what they have) and have a less costly wedding or move the date for a later time where you can afford to have your wedding and not be knee high in debt. Noone wants to start a new life together in deep debt from borrowing. I'm sorry to be so brutal but as an event planner I believed that honesty to yourself and your family and your vendors will ultimately help you and other understand your dilemma. Good luck!"
10767,69470,"Hi Barbara,
When my sister got married 5 years ago, she did BBQ for the sit-down dinner ala my Dad's famous chicken and ribs. :) It sounds terribly messy, but it really wasn't. Her reception was indoors at a nice community hall. All of her guests and our family were thrilled that we were having AWESOME food, so BBQ is not taboo! Just so happens that my Uncle markets his own BBQ sauce, so as a favor everyone received a bottle of the sauce. My sister dressed up the bottles by adding a personalized label and ribbons in her wedding colors which were cream and pastel green.

So for your special day, keep the fine linen and china - it works well with BBQ. Perhaps you could do it Sonny's BBQ style, where you serve the meat, and there are several types of sauce on the tables to try with the the BBQ.

Hope that helps!

11546,61939,"Hi I finally read your message. How exciting to find someone else with the same day :) I will email you soon too. Anyhow on your question, I realized that flowers are so expensive and that was the one thing I wanted too. So we found these fake flowers for me and the bridesmaids that look real and have these beautiful crystals coming out of them as well. Hard to explain but maybe when I get them I will send you a photo. I was having a hard time with the center pieces because I wanted flowers so fake is what we have to do. They up the flower prices at least five bucks a flower on that day. Can you believe that? Anyhow fake is just as pretty and you can save them. Hope I helped a little bit. "
11551,60387,"Thank you to all of you.
Breidie, I looked at  Denim and Laces ,loved the different styles. All I have to do is try and get to that part of Cal. and start trying dresses on.
Have to see if my fiance's vehicle can get down those streets and if it's allowed.
MindyTwirl. I also found a Nordstrom dress that I really like, again, I'm also going to go to this store too, if again, my fiance's vehicle can park there.
Try dresses on until I find one that suits my frame. "

11624,50366,"Love this idea.  But like the last post, I'm not sure how you will incorporate it...good luck!  Sounds beautiful to me!"
11646,52913,"I think thats almost every brides nightmare! You will have dreams of going to your wedding and only you and the groom show up, but that's not reality. I have to say, as the last post says, as long as the ones you love and are closest to come that's all that matters. Put an emphasis on the RSVP in your invitations, too. That way you can get a more accurate headcount of those who know they will attend. You will always have the ones who feel they can come without letting you know, so make sure to factor in a few extra heads just in case.
I am sure that when you are walking down the aisle to your groom, the last thing you will be doing is counting the number of guests.  
I hope that these replies are reassuring to you!

Two restaurants come to mind, that will have a patio or terrace.  Gertrude's located at the Baltimore Musuem of Art and the Bombay Grill In Columbia.  Here are the websites www.gertrudesbaltimore.com and www.bombaygrill.com .

Congratulations,

11650,26876,"i didn't realize that there were words to the song, I've known it all along that it was a classical piece by Pachelbel. I walked to that song and in all my research trying to find the perfect version of it I never did come accross vocals to it. "
11648,26876,"Your MOH is suppose to stand out from the rest of the girls anyway, so I dont think it would look off or anything, I think the only thing that would concern me is the style of shoes for your other girls. I am not sure what style of dress they are wearing, but they wayI imagine it, it kinda looks weird, so maybe you should make sure they buy thin strap sandals, so that there is least emphasis on their shoes, thats if  you decide to go that route. Just remember that you should try to go with something that you know they might wear again."
11642,26876,"I think that trying to transform a room, can get expensive also time consuming if you do it yourself. I tried this for my wedding, and realized that it would just be way over our budget to even try it. Im not sure what you had in mind, but I'd think you want to have unique centrepieces, linens, and and have backdrops or something like that, maybe things coming down from the ceiling. If you don't already have a planner, maybe you may consider one, because they will know best on how to convert a room into something else without having to go into debt, maybe they may even direct you to a place in which you may not even have to do much to. "
11642,70754,"Hey Tiffany,

I am from Delaware County, my fiance is from Bucks County, and we live in center city, I was hoping for a center city, close as possible to the city location within budget ya know. I will check out the site you sent. Thanks for the suggestion. I must admit, I am not familiar with Northeast Philly at all??!!

In response to the Wedding Planner, how much do those cost? Any ideas?"
11565,36988,"Hello!

The photos in our Ideas section are just that, ""ideas"" for cakes, dresses, etc. You are able to download the photos from the Ideas section to your computer and then upload the photos to your binder.  Use the ""Add Image"" button in your binder to do so.

I hope that helps!
  "
11565,70212,"Hi! OK thanks!

I hope it changes soon to where you can just clip them like on brides and theknot. Also it really helps if you ask whoever donates the photos to state the name of the cake maker or what flowers are in the bouquet, etc.

Thanks again"
11648,70212,"Hi, this is ridiculous. You are the bride. No you are not going to have everyone buy silver shoes to match the junior bridesmaid because the aunt went ahead and bought the wrong shoes. Your wedding is not silver.

Just calmly think about what you are going to say. Write it down. Then when you are ready, call the aunt and say in  your own words ""Silver won't work. I need you to get ivory shoes. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear on that. I don't want silver in my wedding."" 

Just make it as short a statement as you can and then bite your tongue. Let her fill the silence. Hopefully she will take in the pause and then say OK.

If she argues do not explain. Just say ""OK what size feet are [junior bridesmaid]? I'll buy her the ivory shoes.""

Perhaps she will back down then and say, no it's not a problem, or perhaps you'll have to get some ivory shoes at Payless. But this is your wedding. And this is not asking too much.
"
11642,70212,"Hi Melissa,

What month are you getting married in?"
11631,39625,"Hi Rachel,
I'm so glad you posted, flowers are my specialty. There are so many gorgeous red flowers. I'm going to list the reds that will work with the Calla Lilly ""Schwarzwalder"" which I believe is the one you will be using for your bouquet.
Ranunculus, their are two shades of red a light one and one that matches the Cally Lilly perfectly. I know you don't like roses but have you ever seen a rose ""Black Beauty""? Just have a look at it, I guarantee it's not a typical rose. Dahlias are great for centerpieces.  Peony ""Red Charm"" is another gorgeous red flower. And if you want to go for with a burst of exotic color have a look at the Gloriosa Lily. 
Personally I would go with Ranunculus, Gloriosa Lily, and my all time favorite sprigs of Orchids ""James Storie"". Since you're wedding is in August, sprigs of orchids for the bridesmaids will be gorgeous.
Take this to your friend, and have a look at my suggestions. Perhaps you'll find exactly what you're looking for.
Good Luck!"

this is the best link I found, where you can listen to the song in full.
You can purchase the cd on amazon, the cd is Libera and the song is called Sanctus on the cd. Check it out! The most inexpensive cd listed is 7$.

11640,57903,"You could include them in your vows. You and your fiancé would do your vows in the wedding as usual, but then turn around to your kids and make vows to them too. You could promise to respect and love them as well (especially the new parent in their lives)."
11642,68058,"I had an out door wedding and transferring that area was extremely stressful and it turned out very expensive. Don't get me wrong my wedding July 14th was beautiful and the weather was perfect..However setting up etc was so overwhelming..I have my own invitation business and I also thought it would be great doing my own wedding favors/invitations etc..I almost went nuts I should've hired someone outside of my business) I can do invites for any bride but when it came to my own wedding I thought I was going to die..there was so much involved with the wedding it self! :) ..I will never get a divorce because I will not go through it again.  With that said: try to limit what you do on your own..get as much affordable outside help as possible. 
"
11648,48751,"Does silver even go with Peridot?  Maybe gold, but I dont think silver...I agree with the previous responses.  Everyone should have the same color shoes, and that color should NOT be silver.  It may seem trivial because they are shoes, but you'll have to look at these pictures for the rest of your life.  Just ask her with love and appreciation for her cooperation."
11551,70248,"You sound so happy!  You still need a beautiful dress for the wedding.  You should look at dresses by Dessy www.dessy.com  They carry beautiful bridesmaids dresses that come in white and ivory.  They have a number that have a hunter sash.  Plus, their prices through our store are awesome.  If there are dresses that you like, please let me know at amicabridesmaid@live.com...also look at our website www.amicabride.com.

Good luck!  "
11524,68058,"This is un-acceptable..Do you know how long she has been in business for? This is your wedding! I just got married July 14th 2007 and I swear I had no idea how difficult it was being a bride until it was time to plan my wedding.  I have my own invitation company so I thought hey do everything myself..let me tell you (heck no) I needed so much attention from everyone involved that if I called you and did not get a response I would go nuts.  Your Planner needs to be all over you like white on rice right now especially so close to the wedding.  (She should have a blackberry) You cannot do wedding planning with out it) Trust me I learned! When you speak to her, get as much information from her regarding everything she has planned with you telephone numbers etc.  Confirm everything on your own..I know it seems hectic but you cannot afford any screw-ups right now..She might be sweet (but sweet does not cut it especially when money is involved) she needs to get the job done! Hope that helps!"
11642,48751,"Hey Melissa.  Weddings on a budget is kind-of my specialty.  I would love to get some more details and help you out.  My sisters and I all have/had to get married in a Horse Arena-basically a big barn on my parent's farm-so I DEFINITELY know how to trandform a space-and it DOESN'T have to be expensive.  You're doing a great job by starting early, that way you'll have plenty of time to test/look/change and get exactly what you want/need for your Big Day.  Check my website for my contact info.  I hope to hear from you!"

9786,68058,"Congrats! You should throw your party before 6 months..it is so new you want the excitement to spread!  My Sister threw hers 3 months after she was engaged! She registered and everything...lol :)"
11633,48751,"DEFINITELY give them an RSVP date and ask them to put the number of attendees on the response card.  Re-check your list and of there are any people over the Magic Number, pick some people to put on a ""gray list""-a list of people to invite AFTER other people tell you they cannot come.  You have to be sure you send your invites out early enough to send a second wave if people RSVP no's.  Also-if you are worried about people asking to bring a date, unless they are in a serious relationship with someone, you should not have to include ""and Guest"" on the invitation.  If you are inviting a single person and do not invite ""and Guest"" they SHOULD not bring one or ask to bring one.  Good luck keeping your numbers down, I hope this info was helpful."
11472,25170,"It's not awkward or weird at all.  I have a business myspace and some of my current and past clients have actually sent me add requests.  As well as me sending them.  This is what these websites are for is to network.  Tell you friend good luck!!"
11549,48751,"I agree that you should denote on your invites that the dress is beach casual.  I think it would be cute to have a place for shoes as you walk onto the beach.  Maybe have a family member who's not already in the wedding run a ""Shoe Check""-like a coat check-each person gets a ticket and the corresponding number goes on their shoes.  Or you could let guests worry about their own shoes and carry them.  I would say use chairs if the ceremony is going to be longer than 20 minutes.  And really think about your guests-will Great-Grandpa George be able to stand in the sand for 20 minutes?  Maybe you could have 2-3 rows of chairs for ""Older"" people/Honored Guests and have everyone else stand.  I agree that blankets may get awkward with skirts.  As far as acoustics and a veil, it will COMPLETELY depend on the day.  I would say get a friend to go out to the beach with you and take a guitar-see how far away you can hear it. Maybe the veil could somehow be tacked to the back of your dress. "

11663,67710,"How long will your bridesmaid dresses be? Maybe if they were knee length they wouldn't blend in with the carpet so well. Is the red carpet the exact same color as the dresses? "
11648,32212,"Are the shoes very obviously silver? Will they stand out at the wedding? If so, then explain that you don't want any silver anywhere in your colors. If they are thin straps and no one will notice, then don't sweat it. I'm sure if you are nice about it and explain why, you can get her to find some ivory shoes. Silver definitely doesn't match ivory and peridot. Tell her when she gets married (if she's not already), she can have a silver wedding or any color she wants. If it's a touchy subject and they think you are being slefish, confide in her about something else and pull her onto your side, it will be easier to convince her to change the shoes."
11663,32212,"Is it possible to get white or black sheets to cover the stage? That would be pretty. Just make sure it's tacked down so no one trips over wrinkles. That happened to me at my dad's wedding when I was younger. That was embarrasing! You could also try making their shoes a different color. It might help break up the red blending together. Or maybe they could wear a different color sash around the waist. I agree that too much red with drown them out. If you do keep the stage red carpet, make sure the bridesmaid's dresses aren't a few shades off from the carpet color. That might look a little strange too. Good luck with your planning!! :)"
11640,32212,"When my dad and step-mom got married me and my brother and little sis were in the wedding. Before they started the ceremony, the precher said a prayer for uniting our families and my step-mom gave us each silver ID bracelets with our names engraved on the front and the wedding date on the back. They were very pretty. I still have mine in my jewelry box at home. It's been since 1996 and every year I wear it to my parent's anniversary dinner. They are touched that we wear them. "
11664,12243,"I think it would only be fair to ask them to participate, and explain if they choose not to do so there would be no problem. Make sure you have a back-up plan."
11631,12243,"You are right. You do not have to use traditional floral such as roses, calla lily,etc. Think out of the box. It is a summer wedding; there is the amaryllis, orchid, hydrangea, or gerber daisy with twigs of pussy willow.  Also consider silk or real touch floral.  You will have it after the special day as a keepsake and,or a gift to wedding party and/or parents. "

11665,62458,"Your bridal party is whoever you want it to be!  There aren't any special rules.  It should be whomever you feel the closest to and feel that they should take a special part in your day.  These days, people are beginning to not even worry if sides are uneven.  It's all about what you want and who you choose."
11648,24939,"her shoes r very noticable i am a very easy going bride i let the girls pick whatever style dress they want as long as its peridot my sister is the only one with a sash and a jacket so you could tell she's the moh thanks for all you responses"
11665,39625,"I think the larger the wedding party the tackier. I have 4 sisters, and a few really good girlfriends I've known since elementary school. I will only be using my two younger unmarried sisters to be part of the wedding. The largest bridal party I have ever seen in person was of 4. And almost every wedding in my family is black-tie. So it's very formal and elegant.
Stick to the MOH and best man if you'd like. Just let the rest of them, know that they mean a lot to you, but to keep things even you'd like to do it this way. Have a job for your brother and step-sister though!
Good Luck!"
11664,70503,"I know you want to make everyone happy, but the only person you please is yourself. My fiance had the same trouble. His mom told him he had to choose one of his brothers as his bestman. Everyone else was telling him it was his decision and to choose who he wanted to. I even suggested having both his brothers be his bestman. He got hismelf all stressed out over this. So in the end he chose to have both his brothers be his bestman. My advice is do what you want to do. Like you said it's your second wedding. You may want something just a little different from the first one (besides the groom that is!) and this may be it. I would talk it over with your sisters and tell them your resonings behind your decision that way you don't have all this tension throughout planning your big day. Good luck, have fun, and follow your heart with what you want to do not what everyone else wants you to do!"
11633,70503,"When you're sending out invitations try to think you have a limit of 90 or 95 guest just in case you have those last minute people that either change their mind or never got back to you. That way you don't end up going over your 100 guest limit."
11282,53336,"I also wanted a dark blue dress for the bridesmaids for my wedding in August, and I found a beautiful blue dress in the color Indigo which is basically dark blue from Watters Too.  The style is very good for the summer - it is light and strapless, but it has skinny straps that you can add if you want to; also, it has some lace and ribbon accents.  If you go to Watters Too, there are lots of dresses that have indigo, just look for anything in Duchess Satin. The dress I picked is style 261 but you have to click on the other color combos to see how it would actually look (they show it in white with white lace and black ribbon).  I hope this helps!"
11665,70503,"I was in a wedding were the bride only had a Maid of Honor and me as a Brides Maid. She had a very small wedding, but it was beautiful. I happen to agree with the other comments, smaller is better. My fiance and I are having three people on each side and I would have been fine with having just two on each side. It is your wedding and it'll be beautiful no matter if you have just a BM and MOH or if you also add a GM and BM. I think the people you have mentioned for the BM, MOH, GM, and BM are good choices and they will always be in your guys' life. Good luck!"
11640,56581,"You also have to option of doing a unity ceremony. For example, after you have done your vows as a couple, light a unity candle together with your children to represent the joining of your families. A sand, wine, or water ceremony (mixing of different colored sand, wine, or water) to represent the making of a new family also have a beautiful symbolism and make a lovely keepsake!"
11626,70503,"It's not that I don't like roses, I actually do like them. I just want to do something different than the traditional rose. Thank you for your advice! "
11517,59126,"Cara,
If you haven't gotten a planner yet, make a checklist for yourself.  Sit down and write down what your priorites are each week, so that way you are not looking at your whole entire wedding, because it is overwhleming.  If you start by accomplishing one thing at a time, it's not so overwhelming.  If you have huge oak trees you might consider hanging candle holders with candles off of them, and maybe decorate the tree itself with flowers. Even string flowers together and drop them from the candle holders.  This could creat a beautiful ceremony site or picture back drop.  You can use string lights of the color of your wedding and use the same colored fabric (sheer) and drape around your head table, maybe put vintage looking candleabras at each edge of the table (garage sale), add flowers.  Maybe use fruit in vases of your centerpieces to give it that country/outdoor feel.  Try going to martha stewart weddings, there will be a lot of other ideas there for you.  Good Luck!  "

Does the base not have an NCO or Officer's club where you can hold your wedding reception? Usually each base has a club that doesn't charge alot of money.

11646,68772,"I think when planning your wedding - you should most definitely invite those that honestly share in your happiness, and if you've done that, they will definitely be there for you and your fiance.  
Most importantly, be happy that you are marrying the love of your life and enjoy yourself to the utmost!!!"
11624,68772,"Although you want a rustic look - I think that maybe turquoise scarves in lieu of bandanas would be more presentable.
But...
it's all about you and if you are comfortable with your decision then go for it!!
(by the way my daughter's name is Taylor Maiye')"
11539,68772,"That is wonderful that you are starting on the right note!!!
You could make them little cards asking them to be bridesmaids with a short quote - something like, 
Marriage will make us family
but our hearts made us friends...
something along those lines.
Good Luck!"
11481,68772,"I think favors are a necessary tool - it is a way of saying, I'm glad you took time out of your day to wish us well.
I think that you should account for favors in your budget when planning a wedding.
It can be something very cost-effective like typing a note on some pretty paper, rolling it like a scroll and tying it with a pretty ribbon.  That will only cost you well under $0.25 per guest.
Just a suggestion - but do what is best for you."
11472,68772,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  He can request to be their friend, they can either approve or deny him."
11419,68772,"You can always print them yourself, or depending on the type of paper that you are printing them on, your local Office Supply store should be able to print them.
Good Luck!"
11417,68772,"It's not tacky at all - go for it!"
11664,68772,"You did a great job explaining how you feel here - let them know those same things and they can't help but to be understanding.
Good Luck!"
11663,26876,"I wouldnt worry about it. Unless they are going to have long dresses that are going to touch the floor then I wouldnt sweat it. Its carpet, people aren't going to notice it, maybe you can have them wear black shoes to give it some seperation if you worried about them blending it with the carpet, but I really wouldn't. And I wouldn't cover your stage with any fabrics, you dont want any accidents! I've seen it before and the bride's heel got caught on the fabric and she sort of stumbled on to the stage, one word...EMBARASSING!!! Tulle will also get caught on heels anyways, so I would not even consider using that if you had to. But, really the carpet will be ok and your girls will not blend in. "
11663,68772,"I wouldn't suggest tulle - but that would be the best idea.  Check out one of the wholesale fabric stores, there are several on Roosevelt/State street.
Good Luck!"
11648,68772,"Simply return the shoes for ivory ones, or just purchase your cousin a pair on your own.
I don't think your aunt should be upset about some shoes for YOUR wedding.

11666,26876,"There are plenty of nice restaurants in the Tysons corner area, and there is a Maggiano's at the Gallaria as well. I would have suggested Lightfoot restaurant in Leesburg, but you want it in fairfax. What kind of cuisine did you have in mind, or what kind of budget will you be working with. "
11664,26876,"I Like the previous posts said, its your decision in the end. I seems to me like you really want your friend to stand next to you otherwise you would have gone the other route. I would probably go with my friend and have my sisters involved with something else, maybe do a reading or something else. Something else I would consider is pictures, I personally wouldn't want to see pictures of my previous wedding with my sisters and then my recent one with my sisters in it as well. Just something I thought I'd throw out there, it may not really matter, but for me it would. "

11648,66405,"It seems like in every wedding there is someone who wants to do it their way and it is nothing you would ever do or want to reflect your taste... For me it was balloons. My stepfather made this huge tacky balloon castle for the childrens area right to the side of the stage where I got married. I really did not want it at all. It turns out my friends realized it was not my taste and gentlty laughed along with me and the children, years later remember that castle to be the funest thing ever. I cant believe it. He helped so much for my wedding, even suppling the wedding and reception location for free because he volenteered part time at the location. My mother gererously provided lodging for my out of town guests and close family and meals for the whole weekend, the support of the two of them was generous and I am so greatful. I am glad I did not say no, as years later it really didn't matter and the kids loved it. Even so, I say buy new shoes for your cousin, tell your aunt you love her."
11665,66405,"I do weddings in Hawaii all the time with just the couple... I usually invite the limo driver to take pictures and my husband to play an acoustic instrument. I believe your wedding is how you want it. I think you may be feeling that you wished you had more friends, friends show up at differnt times in our lives, sometimes too many to keep up with and sometimes only a few. You have the perfect amount of people for now and later you may have too many. The most important thing to remember is to have fun and enjoy your wedding day, Some people get married with just the bridal party and no guests, some with just themselves and strangers as witnesses, some invite everyone they and their family has ever met. It's all what you want to do because it is your day!!! Enjoy and Have Fun..."
11666,66405,"Have you thought about having the Rehearsal Dinner Caterered at a community center or reception hall? "
11549,66405," Congratulations for your beach wedding. My experience is that the acoustic guitar can have a pick up attached to it and connected to a small rechargeable amp. My husband has one and it was not too expensive. The music store can rent one too. It might be nice to be able to hear the ceremony as well. The wind makes voices travel. It would be nice for the videographer to a small mic on the officiate/minister as well. As for the wind and your veil, I suggest a Haku, A flower Lei for your head to hold the veil down when your love pulls it up to see your face. Beautiful. Let the guests take care of their own shoes, no cause needed... Chairs are a must for most of the guests. A rental company will deliver, set up and take down for about .89 c to $2.10 per chair, they also supply arches and other beach décor for soooo reasonable. As for the ceremony I love having a flower ceremony where you remember your life symbolized in flower petals, breath in the fragrance and release unto the wind."
11346,27993,"Wow, This is challenging to be sure... I would talk with your vendors and see if you can get any amount of your deposits back and work out with your wedding planner to have a more simple wedding. Your guests do not expect you to go all out they will be happy with a simple ceremony. A tent, Chairs, tables and flowers can come to $600. The wedding and reception venue can be changed to a less expensive. The officiate can cost as little at $200. A musician to play during the ceremony can cost $100. A simple band to play at the reception can cost $500. Now you have the the caterer for cake, drinks, dishes, and food... You can find someone for $15 to $25 per person. Have friends take pictures and do video. You have your dress, the grooms attair can be reasonable.. is this out of your budget? Then go more simple, beach or park wedding with no chairs or tent, just cake and drinks. Our local health food store makes beautiful cakes. Get a dj for the reception or ask your musician guests to play."
11481,27993,"Favors and all the normal wedding expectaions are always up to you. If you do choose to have favors, you can have them be something you are already doing. One wedding I attended had small potted tree's and flowers on the reception tables for decoration and as a favor for guests who choose to to take home after the wedding. The children had a creation station where they could take home what they made. At my wedding my husband gave away copies of his music cd. I made a salve and the guests could take home as many as they wanted. We only had 100 guests. Sending a cd to press with copies of your wedding music would be a fun way to support your musicians as well as have a gift for your guests. 1000 cd's is around $1000, you could give 300 away and the other 700 to the band for playing at the reception... Be creative and always plan the ceremony you want, it's your wedding to be shared with friends and loved ones to support your marriage as a greater community. Guest will support your choice"
11646,27993," If people do not come it's only because they could not make it and they usually call or sent you an email to let you know that they wont be able to make it.. Some people go way out of their way to be able to make it wondering if you will even notice. I suggest posting a blog and telling people of your plans and that you really want them to come. Your wedding day is sacred and you should enjoy it if there is one or 1000 guests. It is an outward statement to the world of the love and unity you share with your husband. The invitations alone tell people of your love and commitment whether they are able to make it does not reflect their love and support or desire to be there for your moment. Enjoy your wedding day and your event. Congratulations."
11260,27993,"Outside wedding at a local park with a minister to officiate, when it comes to marriage compromise is going to have to happen... I would suggest you look at this together as an inspiration to understand how you are going to approach the decision makeing you will be faced with many times to come. Giving your love his dream is a wonderful thing to do. Him wanting to give you your dream is an amazing feeling. He may have reasons deeper than you know for wanting a church wedding. His family or upbringing may have pressures on him that he is not even aware of. For you it may be a simple location and dream, for him it may be deeper subconcious beliefs and expectations he has not realized until the issue came up. This may happen often as going into marriage unexpected unknown beliefs often show up. Be gental with your love and work out a way to support him as this is your wedding day and contention around any part of it can be very difficult for both of you. Have fun, love him and be gentle. "
11691,27993,"Great question,

I have given it a lot of thought. For guests arriving from the airport late be sure and put in a late night snack, milk, bread, fruit, water, nut butter, jam, chocolate, napkins, fork ,knife, spoon, cups. I like to search out organic ingredients. If you are working with a limo driver have the welcome baskets given  by the driver. Other wise hire a lei greeter (if going to Hawaii) and have the greeter give out the lei's or arrange for the hotel to have them in the rooms. If having the hotel provide the baskets make sure and let your guests know so they do not try and find an open store. Simple food and Chocolate should not get too expensive and the guests well definitly appriciate the gesture as well as be hungry for more than plane food and sleepy after a long flight. A spritz of lavender water would be refreshing as well, but not necessary.

Have fun!!!  I live in Maui and am available for any questions anytime..."
11696,50366,"I don't think that would be a problem.  A blusher could be very formal and attractive.  I believe it is what you are comfortable with."
11664,50366,"I am in a similar situation, with this being my second marriage.  My sister was my maid of honor 25 years ago, but since she is my only sister, I still wanted to have her apart of the wedding, just not the one standing right next to me.  So, I picked my daughter to be my maid of honor and my sister as my Matron of Honor, and that is all the attendants that I am having.  My daughter will stand next to me and then my sister.  

You could tell them that they are special to you and want them to be a part of your celebration but don't want to put them through the whole ""bridesmaid"" responsibilities.  If they say they don't ""mind and would be honored"" than let them be there for you.  Maybe they will want to be a part of the ceremony in a different, less stressful way (like the last poster said). I know if my sister was in the same situation I would want to at least be considered. 

Good luck and congratulations on your second chance at happiness!"

Yes it sounds like there are a few issues with his parents, but what it all boils down to is that you both are in love and happy. Do not let this still your joy! Continue to stay focused on your wedding plans and your future husband. Good luck  and congrats."

11665,65478,"Congratulations!

There are no set rules on how many attendants a wedding party should have.  It will not look tacky to have the amount that you do. Your wedding will be intimate with those that are closet to you standing by you and your fiance's side. Do not feel that you must conform to a certain standard or rule. "

11720,70212,"Hi,

In my situation, I have a daughter who is 14. I'm planning on having her be my maid of honor. But if she was nine and even if I had her as a junior bridesmaid, I don't care what the position is, I would have her standing right next to me. 

It's a big deal for a little nine year old girl to watch her mommy get married. The new situation, new step-father, and the guests watching, etc. and looking at your mother from several feet with people separating you from her...no I'd have my little girl right by my side.

 "
11720,11063,"To be perfectly frank, I wouldn't care much about the height difference.  If you want to give her a title, Junior Bridesmaid would fit fine.  Depending upon how much you're involving her in the ceremony, you may want her standing closer to you anyway!  I have three children and my fiance has two, ranging in age from 4 to 17.  They're all standing with us, but we are also saying vows to our children as well as each other.  If you don't want her to be right next to you, I would suggest having her stand in front of your sister or just on the other side of her.  At my first wedding, I had three bridesmaids and a junior bridesmaid.  My junior bridesmaid and flower girls stood in front of my bridesmaids and it worked out very nicely.  Good luck!  Just remember that the sentiments of the day and your daughter's feelings are much more important than how you think the line up might look."
11640,11063,"I am also in a similar situation.  I have three children from a previous marriage, and my fiance has two children from a previous marriage.  We are having our children stand with us, and the majority of our wedding ceremony is the traditional ceremony.  Well, as traditionally as we're doing it, anyway!  After our vows and exchanging of rings with each other, we're going to say vows to the kids and give them a token as well.  We haven't purchased or decided on the tokens yet, but we're thinking of bracelets for the girls, but haven't decided on the boys yet.  In what I've drafted of my vows so far, I'm basically just promising the kids that I'll always encourage their relationship with their parents, that I'm not replacing their mom, but that I will always care for them and love them as my own kids, etc.  If you have any great ideas, please share them!!"

I am not sure how much you are able to spend on a dress, but have you considered at least looking at David's Bridal?

If you plan on spending about that much on a second hand dress you might consider buying new.  You also have to consider alterations....if you purchase a used dress from someone without being able to try it on first it may end up being too short for you...that would be bad!

11761,39625,"It would be very strange to invite the wife and not the husband, unless it's a family issue. 
My cousin's husband does not get along with anyone in my family (especially my father) and never comes to events, so as requested by my parents I only invited her and her children, since her husband is no longer welcome to any events.

And a friend and not her partner? Is there a reason you don't want her partner there? Normally if the couple has been together for a year or is living together, you would address it as such:""Scott Gamble and Diane Gill"" and send it to the friend. Otherwise you can just write your friends name, and hopefully she won't rsvp with two as guests attending.
Hope this helps!
Good Luck!
"
11762,4007,"If a couple is married (legally, common law, or together so long they are, in essence, married) then both should be invited, if you want to follow traditional rules of etiquette. You should be under no obligation to invite a friend, date, or unnamed ""guest."" Chances are the rude person in question won't come anyway. If you fear the spouse in question will do something unpleasant, do let your wedding planner (or big brother, or other responsible friend) know who they are and what behavior to watch out for so they can head off any unpleasantness.

11640,15248,"There are lots of lovely ways to include the children, doing a sand ceremony, where each child and then the bride and groom pour sand into a special jar and create a piece of are that can be displayed in a special place in your home. This represents the blending of your families into one.  You can give each of them a token of love.  Have your officiate or minister say a few words about families and how children are a very special part of creating a family.  There are so many ways to recognize each child, be creative.  If your minister doesn't allow for this, do a special thing at your reception.  I think it is very important to include them.  Rev Sandy"
11640,20427,"http://www.theweddingoutlet.com/Wedding-Ceremony/Family-Medallion/Family-Medallion-Youth-Ladies-Ring

This website has what is called a ""Family Medallion"" ring, it also comes as a pendant. If you order one, it comes with a book explaining how to present it to the children during the wedding ceremony. Its a beautiful way to include the children, and gives them a lasting reminder that they are a part of something. "
11517,15248,"I agree with some of the other posts, sit down and talk to a planner.  Even if you don't hire the person, which I think you should do at least for the day of, you can get some clear ideas of what will work in the location and what won't work.  Getting a tent is critical, just in case it rains, nothing is worse than not having a counter plan.  You can always use the tent for the reception only and still have your ceremony outside, under the sky.  As an officiate, I always suggest that you start your theme with your ceremony.  The ceremony will set the tone for the day, romantic, elegant, casual, bring the fairies, naturalist, whatever you want.  Most important it is your day, do what you want and have fun with it.  Rev Sandy"
11527,4007,"Doing your own bouquets is a great idea if you're not a stress-y person. If you are, have a back up person in mind!
Here's what I usually do: bride's: 20-25 roses (all/more than half white), +filler (spray roses, lilacs,bouvardia, queen ann's lace, freesia, + greenery)maids: @15 roses (mostly color with a little or no white) Boutonnieres are 1 bloom + a botanical element, groom:2 blooms, ring boys: usually spray roses if they're little boys)
I have a stripper for thorns, but its easier to use leather garden gloves and strip thorns & extra leaves with my hands.
Be sure to cut the ends with a sharp trimmer (not scissors, the crush the stem & makes it harder for the rose to get water - some flowers do need crushing or stem splitting, milky stems need to be seared)& place them immediately back in your very clean buckets of water with floral preservative.
Once you've made the arrangements, you should spray them with a floral hydrator spray & put them in veggie & fruit-free fridge."
11322,15248,"Hi Tiffany, I agree even for an officiate it can be tough working with a bossy maid of honor.  At one wedding last year, I was standing around waiting for the moment to walk into the ceremony site, when this ""bossy"" maid of honor asked me how I knew to wear the color brown.  I told her that I asked the bride, what color she wanted me to wear?  Duh!  Anyway, take a deep breath, sit down and talk to them and explain that although you appreciate each of them, you just want them to come and be by your side on your special day.  I think if you make it clear what you want in a calm way, they will understand.  Blessing to you....Rev Sandy"

You could use a bowl that accomodates floating candles, put the glass gems in the bottom in your wedding colors and scatter fall colored leaves on the table.  Or you could use those leaves to create a wreath upon which to sit the glass bowl.  You can get those bowls cheap at Walmart and also Michael's.  "
11691,62458,"People tend to appreciate items from the locale where you are having the wedding.  This gives them a souvenir to take back home!  Make sure to include items that the city/state/country, etc. is known for.  Additionally, you should always include an itinerary of any events or activities that you have planned for your guests.  And also any items that represent yourself and your fiance', something that people will look at and say ""yep that's just like them"" or something that represents your wedding theme.

Most caterers will have an hors d'oeuvres menu from which you can choose.  Be careful with buffalo wings though, they can be a bit messy for your guests who have dressed up for the occasion!

The bridesmaids and groomsmen are usually announced in pairs, with the Maid of Honor and Best Man last.  Then it's you - the Bride and Groom!

You may or may not want to include the flower girl and ring bearer, depending on their ages.

These are just ideas, though.  You can introduce everyone however you'd like!

11740,43335,"Hi Tiffany,

My dress is what they call ecru which is not white and not ivory. Some call it winter white :-) 

The colors that i went with is sage and burnt orange.... my shoes are Ivory which is a little darker then my dress but very complementary and you can find accessories in the color as well. You are right white clashes very badly with our dress color. So i would say go for the accessory in one of your accent colors. I managed to find a veil in the ecru color and it looks great makes it look like it is an heirloom handed down."

""Do you have this Man/woman to be your wife/husband; to live together in the covenant of marriage? Do you promise to love him/her... shall live? then ""do you (Groom) to take (Bride's) children (their names) as your own, raising them with all of your wisdom, compassion and faith, loving them patiently, tenderly and unconditionally?""

10777,43335,"Hello Susan,

We were in the same position as you. This is our second marriage and we live together, we have all of the household things that we need. We sat down and thought about it, if we were to ask for money what would we use the money for....? OUR HONEYMOON. :) We spoke to some of our family about it and got a few raised eyebrows, but we registered our honeymoon at Honeymoonwishes.com. the money goes into an account and you get the cash however the way the site is designed it makes it more personal for your guests that they feel they are contributing to your honeymoon and buying  you specific packages or services. I really recommend checking it out.

Yes, thank you for the medallion info! I think I'm going to go with the ID bracelet idea. I loved what she said about still keeping it and wearing it. And it seems like it would be good for boys, too.

Nita, thank you for posting the vows! I love the way the children's vow is part of the marriage vows! The only thing for us we can't use a vow that we'll raise the kids as their own because both kids have biological parents and I think they may feel like we're pretending they don't."

I like Laquae's suggestion of throwing white rose petals all over to break up the color and at the same time keep the red carpet in your color scheme.

You are more than welcome to take a look and I hope maybe seeing what I did could spark an interest for you. "
11663,60300,"all the below are wonderful suggestions! I ran into this once and we did the toule across the steps wtih two colors of the wedding in pettle ""lightly"" draped across. I was a wonderful touch! It ended up bringing more out into the pictures as well.. Good luck!"
11640,43335,"Hi Breidie,

I understand your point. It is all on how you feel. Even though you are a step-parent you are still a huge part in how the child is raised. It would have to be something you discuss with your future husband. You both need to discuss how the children will be raised and how much of a role in that you will play in their life. The kids are much smarter then we all give them credit for they know we are not their birth parents hence we can not replace them, but they also know that we are going to be there for the long haul as parents, at least that is how our kids think with us. The way i see it is we fall in the same category as adoptive parents. We are important people too :-) It is all a matter of preference."
11257,60300,"I dont get it?  Why is it that it is considered ""tacky""? to go with something out of the norm? Check the day and age.. we have no rules to follow, Wedding colors are wedding colors, bests are vests, ties are ties... gowns are gowns.... Mix and Mix read the bridal magazines that is what is being said..especially this issue of Brides magazine The largest issue... Tradition is tradtion, follow the something new, old, borrrowed, blue. This is one that will remain for good luck for the bride and goom.. Yet as for what is what for decor, themes.. IT is all out the window! Skys the limit, imaginations are open and free.. What is the difference from doing a camo wedding the doing  a roaring 20's? Flapper gowns Real ones not costumes? Or a sox hop? or heck wanna get tacky a jungle theme?  Nothing.... It is ALL UP TO THE HEARTS of the bride and groom! Period! The wedding is for the bride and groom after all! This is the day they will remmeber for time to come..........ok said my piece... sorry.."
11640,70212,"Hi Nita!

BTW, I LOVE that picture of you and your DF! 

I guess my concern is that the phrase I promise to raise them as my own children, kind of sounds like those movies when a bear finds a human baby or dog finds a piglet, or whatever and ""raises them as their own."" 

I'm concerned they'll think ""Whoa!"" aren't we going back to mom's house ever?

I do like the idea of expressing the longevity of my care for them. I guess I'll have to play with the words til it comes up right for me.

Thanks!

11779,70212,"LOL! Have you picked your dress yet?"
11773,69470,"Hi. Is your wedding indoors or outside? Perhaps you could go with an Emerald green since the May birthstone is emerald. You could then accent create a garden-type theme with mint green, lavendar, and pale pink. You could also save on flowers by choosing daisies in the same lavendar and pale pink colors vs. doing roses.

Just a thought!

11769,69470,"Hello. I think your centerpieces would depend upon whether you're going for a more rustic or elegant <a href=""http://weddingdecorplus.weddingstar.com/search/keyword:fall;"">fall theme</a>. You could do a simple glass charger that you can get from the Dollar Store and cover it with a fall-type wreath. Then, add different sized and different colored candles that match your wedding colors inside of the wreaths. This makes for a simple and very pretty centerpiece.

Hope that helps!

11773,26876,"Its kinda hard to tell you go with ""these"" colors, based on no other detail. I guess the best answer or advice is go with whatever color you like. Most brides often assume that a certain month or season have specific color, but its your wedding so use any color you like, there is no rule that says otherwise. So go with whatever color you may consider your favorite, or if you come with a theme that can be easier as well. As a default I would use black and white, it can give a formal look without spending tons of money. "
11665,70873,"I am only having two people on each side. We didn't want anything big and this seems to work out great. This also means that you will  not have to coordinate as many people to do what you want on your big day. Sometime having a bunch of people up there with you makes it look too crowded, of course that is depending on the location.  I do not think anyone will think that you do not have any friends just that you chose to keep it intimate and close when you decided who you wanted to stand up with you. Hope this helps. :)"
11769,26876,"I think the only thing I would suggest is not to overdo the fall theme, I think the colors are nice, but if you go to literall with it, it may start to look like your having Thanksgiving dinner instead of a wedding, assuming thats not what you want. You don't have to bring in leaves and acorns(just saying) to give a fall theme feel to it. I think the overlay is a good idea. Another thing are apples, those are in season then, and you could buy apples, and place them in a circle around some candles, its cheap and can be eaten afterwards by the guests if they like. I know they may not go with your colors but they go with your theme. I think I can come up with a few more ideas, just let me think about them. Let me know if you want anymore suggestions. "

10169,71745,"Hi Stacy. Although your idea for a beach themed centerpiece sounds great, here is something you may want to consider. You may want to use a grouping of different size hurricane lamps or cylindrical vases to hold pillar candles set in sand and seashells. If you are using a long table, which is now the trend and looks great for an outdoor event, you can make a runner by spreading sand from one end to the other and enhancing it with small seashells and small vases filled with flowers, maybe some orchids alongside, and either the hurricane lamps or the cylindrical vases with candles in them. 
There are so many ideas out there and we are always available to assist and guide you through them, making the planning process much easier for you.

You have been together for almost 8 years... I have noticed that no matter what you chose there will always be someone, many someones telling you your choices are wrong... If you feel like it's time than it's time. I had my first child at 21 and last child at 36. I had soooo much more energy at 21 and better recovery for my body as well. Only you and your husband well know what the right timimg is and all those who tell you to wait would probly tell you you should have had children young if you do wait. Follow your heart and have fun. "

11481,64093,"Don't eliminate it, just find something that fits your budget. I was at a large wedding where they played games and gave away the center pieces. The center pieces were really nice so the guests wanted to win them. Another client gave away small crosses which where purchased south of the border, thus saving money. I've also seen candy buffets that draw all the guests in. It also gives them something to do while they wait. here are some examples: <a href=""http://photos.unveilus.com/photos/265901016_JDELQ-L.jpg"">plane</a>, <a href=""http://photos.unveilus.com/photos/265901032_QMdWX-L.jpg"">cross</a>, <a href=""http://photos.unveilus.com/photos/265901044_kjvP7-L.jpg"">candy box</a>, <a href=""http://photos.unveilus.com/photos/265901008_QpPEp-L.jpg"">candy buffet/bar</a>

11792,26876,"I would say something like (Bride) and (Groom)would be honored if you joined them during their Post-Wedding party, following the reception at (Location). We plan to keep things lively till about (time). 

I guess depending on how you want to send them, either together with the formal wedding invite, you can decide whether you want them to RSVP at the same time with the other response card. I think if you send them at a later date or separate from the wedding invite, you can make it very informal. "
11792,48751,"You can simply call it a ""Post Reception Party"".  
If it is really informal you could say something like, ""The night is still young!  If the Reception wasn't too much for you, meet the Bride and Groom at (place and time)where the celebration will continue.""  
If its more formal (older adults attending) you can say, ""The Bride and Groom request your presence at a Post Reception Party to continue the celebration of their new life together.""
The only concern I have for you is who is being invited.  I feel like you may need to invite everyone to the after-party so that no one feels left out, but I don't know your situation, so I'm not sure that would work.  The people who prefer the non-alcohol reception will most likely not attend the after-party anyway, but at least they wouldn't feel left out or uninvited.  Just something to think about.
Good luck, sounds like fun!"
11788,48751,"I have to agree, only YOU can decide what's best for you.  If you feel its and time and that your life, finances, and home are prepared for a child, then it's probably time.  I have friends who had kids right away and love it, and I have friends who have been married over TEN YEARS and are completely content to wait two more years to have kids.  My husband and I have dogs instead of kids for now, but plan to have kids in 3-7 years (I know thats a long span, but we're enjoying ""just us"" right now).  My goal is to be able to put at least $350 a month from the time they're born into a college fund for our kids-that way by 18 they'll have at least 75,000.  So I think finances are the biggest reason we want to wait."
11773,68772,"Definitely go with something light in color, since it will be summer.
Take a look at a few actual bridesmaid dresses and see what you like best."
11762,68772,"I personally think when inviting someone you should always expect for that person to bring a guest unless they state otherwise in their R.S.V.P. 
I don't think it's fair to determine how serious someone's relationship is because they are/aren't married, and a lot of married couples may not attend as a couple.
So - whenever I make invites to any party, I expect the guest to bring someone along."

That does sound fun! I'd love to see it - Can you post a picture of it?"
968,70212,"Hi,

From my first marriage, my dress sits in my closet mostly now, but I'm an actress and have used it in historical situations!

I know what I plan to do with this coming dress. I read someone post somewhere that she wears her wedding dress every year on their anniversary, I believe, even when they go out to dinner.

That's what I want to do! I'll get to use it for a lifetime, plus the vision of me in the dress will remind us both of that happy day when we were young. :)

Tulip ""Ile de France""
Any orange or peach colored flower is gorgeous!
Alstromeria ""Yellow King""
Daffodil
Tulips ""Monte Carlo"" & ""Winterberg""
Mimosa
Rose ""Alsmeer Gold""
Iris ""Golden Beauty""
Any green flower will compliment everything else, especially Dendrobium orchid ""Fatima"" or Calla Lily ""Green Goddess"". Blues, Lavenders, and pinks in any shade will be beautiful.
My bouquet suggestion though is:Fresh herbs mixed with ""Sterling"" roses, white freesia and sweet peas. It will be a fragrant bouquet.
I have other bouquet suggestion, so if you're interested just ask!
Good Luck!"

yes you can give one invitation, that way some people don't feel required to go. And the people you rarely speak with would probably thing it's kind that you aren't singling them out. 
I'd just write on the envelope: ""Name of Law firm co-workers""
Or you could write a note to go along with it, saying all co-workers are welcome to join us, info is on the invitation. Let me know if you will be attending!
Stick it somewhere everyone would see it!

It sounds like you're handling it the best way you can. I would recommend you hold onto the cream shoes once you buy them for her and bring them to the ceremony, lest your aunt ""forgets"" them.

11805,26876,"What I would suggest is working with an agent. We had the same problem and also saw that most site require either to pay in full or a deposit with small chances of you changing your mind about it. An agent will work totally around your budget. We're going to Belize this summer and our original budget was the same $2500, not all inclusive because there aren't very many over there. Our agent hooked us up with 8days all flights, ground transportation, and activities(scuba, snorkeling, cave tubing etc.) for about $1800. She saved us $700!! Hopefully you would be able to find one that can save you money as well, I think most dont even charge you a fee."

I think what site you choose depends a lot on what kind of feel you're going for.  We wanted lots of color and something kind of funky, so we had our engagement pics taken at <a href=""http://www.thelab.com/"">The Lab</a> in Costa Mesa.  You can see a couple on our profile. =)

Are you looking for something traditional?  Fun and beachy?  Or maybe a pretty park?  There are a ton of options close to Whittier.

I was only 21, and I had our son when I was 22.  In some ways, I wish I had waited a little longer and been a little more established, finished my education first, etc., but for the most part I'm happy with the way it's worked out.  It's been a challenge to finish school and start my career with kids already at home, but it would have been a challenge to start my career and try to figure out when to have kids also.  In the end, only you and your husband can make that decision.

Also, the overall feel I want my decor to give off is romantic but bold. As for your colors, I think it depends on what type of feel you are going for.

However, though no actual intercourse, we decided to do other things to take the edge off. Your date is very far off. And for me, I couldn't wait that long. 1 1/2 years...yeah, long time for me if I have a man (if I didn't, no big deal--I can do the length). But if ya'll can do it, that would be great.

10158,21232,"This is another strange question, do you have an engagement ring and wearing it?  Even if you did, here's the thing...  What I've come across is, that today the word ""fiance"" is being used so loosely.  People say ""this is my fiance"" because, either, they're living together, or sleeping together, and they have a spiritual guilty feeling about all that. So they introduce the person as their ""fiance"". YET, here's the kicker, they DON'T have a wedding date!! So there's people out there that constantly say ""this is my fiance"" with every girl/boy that they're dating! I've run across people who don't know how to take that I'm engaged..it's like they hesitate to even ASK if there's date. So, I smile and proudly say ""Yes, I'm engaged (show the bling) and we're getting married July 5th."" Usually I get a ""WOW, you got a date?!"" And when I tell them all about the reception place and church...it makes it all ""real.""  So now, when I run across people, there isn't that ""hesitation"" anymore."

My thing was the bouquet and garter toss. I never did like to do those when I attended weddings, so I'm having a Scratch-off. You can also just use few gifts instead. All you have to do is buy some business cards from Office Max (or Depot), print those off and order some scratch-off stickers.

It's just so much more ""freestyle"" than theKnot which is more limitted on what you can do. Fortunately, I hadn't put much info on theKnot yet and was able to just put in an email for them to delete my ID. WeddignWire is SO much better and I've told that to everyone I come across who keep saying, ""Oh! Use The Knot!"" I'm like, ""On no! Use WeddingWire!"" They're like ""Huh""? I think since theknot is so known, that's the first thing people think of, and they really hadn't gone and checked it out versus other websites.

11557,4537,"Great Question Tanya! Every Bride wants to know whether they should chose Traditional (meaning cream or liquid foundation applied with a sponge or brush) or Airbrush Makeup (liquid makeup sprayed by an airgun powered by an air compressor).  First of all, a makeup artist may use a water based or silicon based product-this is why you might have heard of streaking.  Traditional makeup, applied correctly, will last just as long as it's Airbrush relative. The advantage of the airbrush is as follows: you will have an extremely soft, diffused finish. It is also THE tool if you have excessive redness or discolorations on your complexion. If your skin is less than perfect, the airbrush will transform it. If you already are blessed with a wonderful glowing complexion, the airbrush will make it that much more enhanced.  I have done trials where I did half the face Airbrush, and half Traditional just so the Bride can have a real read on the technique. Always get a trial, and always take pictures! "

you should never word what type of gifts you want. Let close family and friends know that you would like monetary gifts and gift cards, so they can spread it around by word-of-mouth.

Another thing you can do is register online at 2-3 places, and select that you only want gift cards. It's very convenient for guests, and they will get the picture that your after gift cards and money.

Usually the stores you register at give you tickets to include in the invitation, but if you don't receive those, once again, word-of-mouth!

Also, another way to save financially is not offering an Open Bar to your guests. Actually, the Open Bar takes up most of your budget. By offering red and white wine on the table along with a glass of champagne for the toast should take care most of your guests. It also sets an elegant tone to your reception.

11839,52913,"When on a budget you have to be creative and that is my forte! My suggestions are to use lots of candles, which you can buy inexpensively and they create an atmosphere of romance. Also you can purchase glass beads in the colors of your wedding and layer them in glass vases surrounded by votive candles and flower petals. Since you are on a tight budget, I would eliminate the use of floral centerpieces on each table and use your bridal bouquet along with your bridesmaids bouquets at the headtable. Use bouquet holders attached to the front of the headtable to hold the bouquets.
As far as wedding favors are concerned, I would recommend going with favors that are edible. Go to Sam's Club or your local wholesale center and purchase an assortment of candy. Place in glass or acrylic containers for your guests to fill in white bags. Guests seem to enjoy favors that can be eaten! 
I hope these ideas help!

11859,26876,"I had a monogram cake topper, I just ordered the letters and I painted and decorated them myself, I may spent no more than $25 on it. I  have a picture of my cake with the topper on my slideshow in my website, its towards the end. I think monograms give it a more modern and elegant look. I think nowadays, improvision pays off, so if you see something you like, try making it yourself. I made a lot of the decor on my wedding myself and spend a lot less.

11886,54659,"You are absolutely allowed to enjoy your wedding!  This is a new start for both of you two.  Enjoy the day.  According to most etiquette books-  It is only in regards to the brides status.

Here is what Cranes Blue Book States:

"" A bride who is being married for the first time to a groom who is marrying for the second (or more) times, typically, has her invitations issued by her parents.  In other words, it is the bride's status that determines the wording of the invitation.  The groom's previous marital status does not affect the invitations.""

That being said- your entire day should be based around you being a first time bride.  Remember you can make your wedding as wonderful as the love you have between you.  Talk it over with your fiance and come to an agreement that you both feel wonderful about.

I hope this helps and please let me know if I can be of any more assistance.

I would advise for you to plan the wedding of your dreams. As to your loves family send them an email explaining your dream wedding and invite them to take part in whatever areas they would like to. Let them know specifically what parts to the ceremony and reception and all other wedding activities you would love there assitance in and let them offer any finacial help as they feel inspired. They will need an invitation at this point because it is as unclear to them what their involvement should be as it is to you. I also suggest a wedding blog or free website to let family and guests know about your progress and have a place to offer there assistance. Planning a wedding is a big event that takes a team of people from hired vendors to friends and family. Its the day most girls have dreamed of their whole lives. WE all know this... Live your dreams"

Tell your parents and wedding party to advise money as gifts and know grandma will still get you a gift, She can not help it...

I had the honor of singing the vocal part of Canon in D, at an awesome wedding back east. 

Even if you can't find a choir to perform the vocal part of it (very expensive), a soloist would be able to accomplish that tender, lilting melody.  You want a soloist who understands the need for their part to flow effortlessly against the entire piece.

I too, was surprised to find there was a

Good luck to you, and congratulations on a very wonderful choice in songs.   You have good taste!

I wouldn't choose that route,even if they were edible or safe.

Here's why....unless you can insure the perfect temperature from florist to baker, the weather, the room temperature, and other
unpredictable factors, very possible they're not going to remain as fresh as you'd like up to the moment of guest eyes gazing.

Today...depending on what city you live in...there is a Huge...trend in cake ""designers""...who do nearly flawless ""fondont"" (icing )flowers..sculpted by them...to match the flowers you had in mind.

I've researched many cake designers in Los Angeles....and truly, some are unbelievable. Their ""fondont"" (icing)...flowers are awesome and safely edible ! If you go that way...ask what their limit is for how many cakes they design for a weekend.  If it's beyond 3 or 4...I'd search elsewhere.  Fewer cakes made...the more perfect yours will be.

""Cake Studio"" Los Feliz of L.A. is perfection. Good Luck!"
11852,60555,"Unfortunately, traditional etiquette indicates it's inappropriate to include any type of wedding gift requests in your invitations.  This includes the little gift registry cards you receive from many specialty and department stores.  If you would like mainly monetary gifts the best way to go about it would be to register at only one location for only a small number of items.  Spread the word to friends and family that you would like mainly monetary gifts and also let them know the one store where you've registered.  They can spread the word to other friends and family through word of mouth.  And, in the end I'm sure your family will understand as you aren't establishing a new home together so there isn't much in the way of actual gifts you need.  Just a thought, if you're taking a honeymoon there are websites that will allow you to register for your honeymoon expenses and guests can contribute monetary donations towards your trip.  

Good luck!

11882,26876,"What I did was, I had my first dance ""You"" by Jesse Powell, and then about 3/4ths of the song the DJ interrupted it with a very up beat Merengue, thats when our wedding party jumped in. It really set the mood for the rest of the night. I've seen a lot of couples do that sort of thing, when they have their first dance with a slow song and then interupt it with a fast song, its really surprising for your guests. If you think your attendants are willing to go the extra mile and do something coordinated, you go do that to. hope this helps."

I don't know of any polite way of asking for cash except for simply not registering.  I think most of your guests will (or should) want to give you and the groom something, so more than likely they may ask where you're registered.  At that point, I'd politely respond that you have been living together and have all the housewares you need... most people should get the hint that they should simply give cash at that point."
11926,61177,"Typically, the parents of the flower girl would pay for the dress.  However, if you are able to pay for a portion of her outfit as they will be buying more than a dress, I am sure it would be greatly appreciated.  If you are looking at ways to minimize costs for the outfit, don't think you have to go to a ""bridal store"".  You can find great dresses at Macy's, Nordstroms, Penney's, etc., for a fraction of the cost.  

I think a sleeveless dress would work, but you might consider getting her a jacket that would go with your theme...cropped faux fur jacket, capelet, etc.  If your day is cold a child will not deal with the weather as well as an adult.

An idea on your color...if you are using any colored flowers, get the sash in that color or a lighter version (lavender with dark purple flowers, pink with red flowers).  A trendy silver sash would be cute too.

11813,73225,"We have a celtic themed wedding, since the only thing my fiance requested was that he could get married in his kilt.  Because of that, we're using his Stirling tartan as a base for our colors, blue and green with possible hints of red and yellow.  It should be really pretty, and a bit unusual."
11151,73225,"I'm really excited for my rehearsal dinner, and I'm not sure it's something I would personally cut.  I'm really looking forward to the chance of having all of my closest friends and family together, if only for a day or two.  However, I do understand the tight budget, so the backyard party seems like the best idea to me."
11813,70212,"Hi I saw a custom wedding dress site in Britain and (I think the groom was dressed in his kilt and) the bride had her dress made with tassels carrying the same pattern and colors of her coat of arms."
10748,73225,"Talking to parents can be difficult, and I'm not sure anyone can tell you how to do it.  However, I'd suggest sitting down and trying to talk to them as calmly as possible.  Try to agree to listen to each other's entire thoughts before adding your own.  Perhaps there is a good reason that they want you to wait.  Ultimately, if you can't come a compromise, think about which is more important, being married or your relationship with your parents?"
11813,47365,"Hi,
My colors are pool water blue and accent color of tangerine. My wedding is in August and I will use the tangerine color in the flowers and decorations."
11813,70212,"Hi Duchess,

That sounds so pretty! My question is, how do you find things the exact shades...not just medium blue and orange, but pool water and tangerine?"
11822,20427,"Every flower girl I have ever seen has been in white. Something about her being a smaller version of the bride..."
11916,20427,"Wedding dresses are white to symbolize purity, and a long time ago, virginity. But with those two things being in short supply in todays society, white has become just another color. So why not wear a color that represents you or how you feel? I think its a wonderful idea! And the crowd will probably gasp when they finally see you! What a neat reaction you'll get! "
11942,50366,"I am so sorry that this happened to you.  Unfortunately sometimes weddings can bring out the worst in people when things are a little tense.  

I would make the suggestion of maybe getting a formal picture with all of the family together, and you can wear your wedding gown and he can wear another tux or suit.  It won't be the same, but it will mark a great time in your life with a few pictures.

Congratulations on your marriage, and I hope that you can work this out, without too much drama.:-)  But I would not have another party just to do a retake of pictures."
11665,64266,"Congratulations...

I do wedding's of 50 or less...one person on each side of you is just fine. You could have the groom waiting for you with the officiant and no others...anything goes...a small wedding keeps your day intimate and it will give the guess something to remember..

Best of luck"
11942,26876,"I think what your trying to say is if you can have everyone dress up again like in the in your 1st wedding?  I think it would be ok, the only problem I see is if your groomsmen wore tux's and rented them, they would have to rent them again. I can see a problem with that. Unless, you are willing to pay for them, I wouldn't try to ask them to do that. Im sorry about your disasterous experience. "
11943,26876,"It wouldn't be a bad idea for YOU to go have a look yourself and get an idea of what you'd like to see them in. You can get dresses in any color all year round. If you have a variety of Body shapes and sizes in your party, you may want to take that into consideration. Don't decide on a color that will make some of your girls feel unflattering others feel great. Even though the spotlight is not suppose to on them completely, they are in your party and deserve as much respect and you. There are a lot of things you need to keep in mind. I have to agree with you mother and say you wait a little to get the dresses, but its never to early to go idea shopping. Good Luck"
11916,53299,"If you do not want to wear white then dont. A while back white wasnt even the color for wedding dresses, it only became that way because of the fact that dyes were so expensive. The only reccomendation is that if you are going to go for another color make sure that it really fits your personnality. You do not want everyone to be saying ""why didnt she wear white"". You want everyone to say  ""that dress was the best choice"". Good luck!"
11909,53299,"The dress should bustle, just ask the seamstress."
11882,53299,"I am not going to have my bridal party dance together. I think that they would all be more comfortable not doing it. The day is about you and your new husband, the bridal party doesnt need their own dance. Just my suggestion."

11517,69794,"What about choosing a theme or personality for your wedding/reception. This will help narrow down your options and everything should fall into place. Since your wedding will be on a farm, what about a summer harvest theme or summer flower theme. I hope this helps. Keep in mind your reception is a party to celebrate yours and your new husbands new life together, so there really are no rules as long as you and your guests have a great time! "
11640,43335,"Hi Breidie,

LOL, I just love how you put that, LOL you killed me. It is all a matter of interpretation and preferance. When i read that I did not have that type of feeling come over for me. I guess that is why for us it would work. But for you on the other hand i would agree you will need to play with the words unless you plan on dragging them back to your cave. LOL 

Blending families is a challange all on their own this might be why so many people opt to make the wedding about them only and encorporate the childeren in a different way on their own time. 

You really crack me up girl!"
11859,48751,"My husband and I had our initials on our cake.  It probably cost us about $8-10 for all of the supplies.  I bought wooden letters from a craft store and painted them with our wedding colors, we put flowers on the back and used regular wooden skewers to stick it in the cake-you can see a pic of it on my website in the photos section-and also in the picture of all the cakes.  The nice thing is you can totally match your colors, and if you like to be creative, its actually a fun/relaxing project amidst all your other planning."
11640,70212,"LOL thanks Nita (still LOLing)

Well I'm getting so many awesome ideas from you ladies on this thread, I'm so excited to incorporate the kids into the ceremony!

Breidie"
11916,73339,"I love your idea!  I'm not traditional in any sense (I'm not taking my fiances name, I'm keeping my nose piercing in for the day, etc..) so I say embrace it!!  Doing what you want should not cause controversy.  I don't subscribe to the ""it's your day do what you want"" thing cuz I think too many women take it too far but really you should do what makes you happy.  I don't think a riot will ensue if you don't wear white.  Rock the purple dress!  I like purple better!"
11859,73339,"If you're looking to save money have you considered not putting anything on there?  I mean, my fiance and I aren't going to.  We couldn't find any cake toppers that weren't tacky or outrageously priced so we said forget it!"
11665,73339,"When my cousin got married he had one best man and the bride had one maid of honor and that was it!  They each had one person stand up.  Besides, it's not a competetion of who has the most friends.  You don't want to ask someone simply to fill an empty space and then regret it cuz then you can't take it back.  My fiance and I are having four people each stand up.  In my experiences with other peoples' weddings, the more people you have the more likely drama ensues."
11753,73339,"The gifts thing might be a little overboard but I can tell you, from a natural planners perspective, I HATE when people don't RSVP and worse I hate having to call them.  The only thing I can say is that maybe they didn't figure they needed to RSVP cuz they are close family, not like extended cousins or something.  For example, I wouldn't expect my parents, his parents, siblings or people standing up in the wedding to RSVP cuz it's kinda a given."
11852,73339,"You can't.  Sorry dear.  If there was a way I would do it too!  I have lived with my fiance for 2 years and have everything I could want or need.  My advice is to ask for upgrades.  For example, my fiance and I have bed sheets but what we would really like is a 600 thread count set with a nice down comforter.  Or, we have nice silverware but we got it discount so we will ask for nicer silverware.  Get what I mean?"
11822,73339,"Our wedding colors are brown and pink and how we are working it is the bridesmaids get dresses in brown with pink accents and the flower girls are getting pink dresses with brown accents."
11943,73339,"It doens't hurt to look but don't be hasty in making a decision.  My fiance and I are getting married in September this year and I just had the girls order their dresses by February 1st.  Most bridal places ask you to order 6-10 months from the wedding day so you have PLENTY of time.  If you are really concerned about it call a bridal store and tell them when your wedding is and what you were thinking and what did they think was the best time to begin looking for dresses.  I'm sure they would be more than happy to help!"
11948,56581,"In a situation like this, I always think its a good idea to put all your cards on the table. Let your friend know that care about her and really value your friendship, but that you also have the right to be friends with other people. While you understand that she doesn't like her future SIL, you can't be put in the middle of it. "
11943,62458,"Just remember that when you go to a bridal shop, the fashions are usually a season ahead.  So some of the things you look at right now, may very well be unavailable when you're actually ready to order the dresses.  So make sure to ask the store if any of the styles or colors that you like will be discontinued prior to your wedding date.  Buying dresses that will be discontinued can sometimes work in your favor also because they may be sold at a discounted rate.  Good luck!"
11926,62458,"It's really up to you who should pay for the dress.  Customarily, the parent of the child attendant pays for the dress.  However, if that parent is also serving in another capacity in your wedding and they also have to purchase attire, it would be a great gesture to go ahead and purchase the child's dress.  As far as a sleeveless dress, I think that's fine, just be sure that she has a sweater or something to put on after the ceremony.  Good luck!"
11786,33103,"The National Association of Mobile Entertainers has a number of DJs in your area.  You can visit their website at http://www.locateadj.com/ to find someone near you.

Best wishes for an outstanding wedding day!"
11788,73225,"Good for you!  My fiance and I will be 22 and 23 when we get married, and as much as I'd love to have kids right away, I don't think we'll be financially stable.  I hate the idea of being old parents, and I'd love to see my kids grow up to have kids and maybe even to see those kids have kids.  Seeing my great grandkids would be really cool!  That's not something that can really happen if you wait until your 30's to start having kids.  I'm hoping to start in my mid-20's.  Not quite as early as I'd like, but practical and gives me time to settle in and get some alone time after the wedding and before kids.

Don't listen to the people who tell you you're too young.  It was only 100 years ago or so that people were getting married at 16 and 17 and having kids right away.  Good luck!"
11740,73225,"My dress is a bit darker ivory and I was lucky to find a veil to match the same day.  For jewelry and accessories, I'm going to use gold.  It's not what I usually wear, but it compliments the dress really well, and on the whole I think it will look really good!"
11882,73225,"I'm not sure about what to do for the song, but here's an idea on dances:

I worked as a server for a catering hall for a while.  One thing I noticed while observing other weddings, is that guests get really restless if the dances get too long.  One wedding had a dance for the couple, one for the bridal party, and one for bride and her father and one for the groom and his mother.  By the end of all of the dances, the guests had lost some of that excited energy.  

So keep it short and have some fun fast music for the bridal party dance to kick things off.  It is your day, but if you keep your guests in mind then the whole atmosphere will be a lot more energetic and fun."
11952,46106,"Oh dear.  I hadn't even thought about that.  I have no idea what I'd do with with Mr. and Mrs. Notmylastname stuff!!  I have no answer, but I will be eagerly awaiting others' responses."
11852,22715,"Traditional etiquette states it is wrong to suggest any type of gift at all. As a wedding planner, I DISAGREE. I find that now and days it is honestly accepted more than frowned upon. As quest do not want to waste there money on gifts you do not want or will not use they rather give you what you want.
More than likely your guest already are aware of your age and current living situation and will most likely just give you cash or a gift card. For those who are more boxed gift givers, I would maybe pass a few wanted items around via word of mouth. Have the mothers mention the wanted gifts to family and friends as well as have wedding party members do the same.
Another option for you is to set up a wedding website and include a wishing well. This will allow your guest to deposit money right into a special account, and will tastefully get the point across.

11952,55641,"Don't register for anything that would be likely to be personalized? 
If there is anything you get that has engraving, embroidery, etc, you can probably have it removed somehow.

Technically speaking when you get married you are still Mrs HisLastName even if you keep your own name, as Mrs literally means ""the wife of"". So unfortunately you will likely be facing a lifetime of being referred to as Mr and Mrs HisLastName even if that is not what you want."

11971,26876,"The engagment party is a way to announce and celebrate your future union. You usually invite those closest to you, friends, family, etc. It can be done atleast 1year prior to wedding. But, you dont want to do it too late or too soon after your engagement. for example if your wedding isant for another 2years you dont want to do it right away, you may want to wait a little bit. There doesnt have to be a theme, for your engagement is the theme. You can do something like Hor'dourves anc cocktails. It doesnt have to be extravagant like your wedding reception. Another thing although some people may expect gifts, I wouldn't it just seems kinda selfish, in my opinion at least. So when you send invites don't mention anything about gifts, its the same for the wedding invite as well. "

11967,69470,"Hi Kendra,
This choice is really yours and your families' decision and of course, the budget. What's more important is concentrating on preparation for marriage, rather than a big wedding ceremony/reception. If your budget allows for a small wedding, then hold a small wedding. You won't want you and your fiance' to start your life together in debt because you threw a wedding out of your budget. Your true friends and family will understand. Your ages are really not a factor in this decision.

Hope that helps!

- does it feel right, have the look that you are looking for?
- how convenien?t is it?  for the guests-  the distance from the ceremony. How's the parking
-  will the location work for your set -up  (how long will it take to decorate it and break it down-  will they give you enough time?)
- do they make you use their vendors?  some people prefer the ease of this but I would rather find vendors who reflect my taste

I have a few questions.

I understand how you must have felt him keeping your marriage a secret. But was it worth sacrificing the intimacy and trust of your marriage?

How is your relationship with his mother now? How is his relationship with his mother now? And what is your relationship with your husband like?"

You're right, I didn't ask him. I can't talk to him about the plans until after tax season because he's an accountant. And we have a couple of years.

That could have ultimately made her dislike me and we are bonding very well. I really like my mother-in-law. "

11942,69027,"You could wait a few years and renew your vows. I think then your family and friends won't mind pulling out the old dresses and tuxes. I wouldn't put too much of a burden on everyone and have another wedding, plus those things are quite expensive. Even a party is up there."
11973,65478,"Congratulations on your engagement!

Some other things to look at when choosing a venue such as a banquet hall are catering. Do you have to use the in house staff or can you bring in a caterer of your own? Are the menu selections flexible, can you substitue items or create your own menu? Do they offer a tasting, believe it or not some facilities do not.

I would love to discuss planning your wedding in more detail. If you don't already have a wedding planner. Please feel free to contact me.

Best Wishes,

11981,58465,"I have an account set up with my wedding funds so I tend to pay by check. In some cases, I use a credit card.

every vendor has a different contract about payment-  out of the 5 vendors I have booked so far, only 1 asks for/allows payment on the day. All the others require you pay in advance.

I don't plan on tipping most of my vendors!  My caterer builds in a 15% tip. And the rest-  I plan only to tip if they work for a company- not themselves- or they really go above and beyond-    HTH"
11973,26876,"One thing I've been told is to check out their bathrooms. I know it sounds silly, but if their not clean or up to your expectations, then you assume it'll be the same for the rest. Also, the ask is they have any packages, what are the do's and don'ts. Its really all common sense, it may seem like a lot but when you have a vision in your mind about your wedding it'll just come to you and you'll know what to ask and look for. "
11982,26876,"Its not necessarily wrong, but the point is that people want to see you walk down the aisle and watch you get married. Of course they want the free food and drinks, but more than anything I think they'd want to see the ceremony. If you think you'll be that nervous, you may want to have a very intimate ceremony like close family and very close friends, that way it'll seem more understandable to the other guests who don't make the cut to the ceremony. In my opinion, I think you'll be fine. A lot of brides feel the same way and then  they are actually up there with their handsome groom saying their I Do's nothing else matters and you forget who's watching. I mean it I felt the same way too, but it meant so much to me that everyone be a part of the whole thing and not just the eating and drinking. "
11981,26876,"It really all depends on the vender, thats something you need to check with them. We paid our deposite with our checkcard, and then when it was time to pay the remaining balance we were going to put it on our AMEX and they did not accept it, so we were kinda screwed for a minute. So I would double check everything with them. And about the tipping, I don't think its your obligation to tip everyone, your already paying them to do it for you, and the employee's are getting paid by the company you paid to begin with. But, its up to you. Thankfully, we didn't have to tip anyone all of our vendors didn't accept tips!!"
11788,67772,"Wow...you gusy are kinda like me & my FH. By the time we get married we will have been 2gether for almost 7 years & we are both in our 20s (25 & 28 by the time we actually tie the knot next year!).  I really wanted to start trying for a baby like right after the wedding, but FH wanted to wait at least a year..so we compromised & said wait 6 months after the wedding to start trying.  Sometimes it takes a while, so you never know - it may end up being a year.  

Ok, so back to your situation - you guys are young, but if you are ready to have a child & both want it then I say do it! Just make sure your financially stable and have extra money (b/c kids costs lots 'o $$) and also make sure your emotionally ready - i hear the first year is REALLY hard on new parents. Good luck!"
11981,65478,"Congratulations on your engagement!

I always advise my clients to pay using check because the funds can be easily traced using your bank. This helps to keep track of payments for your records in case you need to go back later.  If you do use a credit card a debit/credit card may be a better choice to track payments as well.  Most remaining balances are paid between 30 days and 1 week prior to the event.  As an added service to my clients if any final payments are due the day of the wedding I gather those payments at the wedding rehearsal from my clients and distribute those payments to the vendors the day of.

When it comes to tipping, it is custom to tip for good service. If you feel that your vendors have provide excellent service to you and your guests then a tip of 15%-20% will be greatly appreciated by your vendors. Please note that you can also send a thank you note to your vendors within 30 days of your event complementing them on excellent service provided.

Best Wishes"
11982,5074,"That is a delicate situation. Explaining that you only want close family and friends to attend the ceremony may be enough for some people, but not a good reason for others...especially if they think they are a close friend. Be prepared for some hurt feelings."
11981,5074,"It is best to check with the venue first to see how they would like the payment. If you are willing to make a deposit on your first site visit, I'm sure they will be more than willing to take your money :)"
11788,26876,"Yeah, I think I've been ready for kids emotionally atleast for the longest time. We both love kids and my biggest concern is that my dad is in his 60's and I want him to be around long enough to enjoy his grandson/daughter. Financially, I think we got that in check, and we always have the support of our family, which say to wait but once they hear those sweet cries I know they'll be happy! Thank you all for your responses. "
11805,39154,"I agree the best thing you can do is find a good travel agent.  Interview them like you would any other business service.  A good agent will steer you in the right direction and will be able to work within you budget.  They want you to use them for life, so a good agent will try and deliver what you want for your honeymoon."
11967,70831,"Why wouldn't it be ok? It doesn't matter how old you are. You should only do this once in your life so why not go ""big""?"
11978,21232,"I think you should seriously apologize to him. Just because you were dared to go tell your mom and she knew (and you chose to do it), doesn't mean you should forced him to do it as well. Think of his side. If you told him not to tell you mom something, and he went behind your back and told her anyway, then yeah, I think you would be pretty pissed too. You would also be telling him that he goes and do things anyway without your consent.  Let him deal with his family and you deal with yours.  There are other ways to persuade your life-mate on things that make you very uncomfortable. I think eventual, with some time, he would have seen your point of view if you had allowed it.  And you should NOT have felt guilty lying. He was lying too.  When the truth eventually came out, then you could have told her you wanted to tell her the truth but you wanted to respect your husband. That puts the blame back on him. But now, there's going to be a trust issue between the two of you. So apologize."
11981,46106,"I always put everything big on my credit card if I can instead of using a check.  You just pay it off right away and collect rewards points!"
11971,65478,"Congratulations on your engagement!

The purpose of an engagement party is to announce your upcoming wedding. It can be as simple as a cocktail party, luncheon, or dinner. Guests invited are those family and friends closest to the bride and groom. You can also use this as a meet and greet for the wedding party and future inlaws. 

You do not have to necessarily have a theme. But, your theme for your wedding can start with your engagement party. Ideas: What are your interests, hobbies, what foods do you like, what are your taste in music. Just to name a few suggestions.  Above all make it fun! Make it a celebration that reflects who you and your husband to be really are.

Best Wishes"
11952,56581,"I am sooooo keeping my last name, and I hope that people that know me are aware of that. But for those that are not, we included it in our wedding website on a FAQ page (http://luisandgeneva.googlepages.com/faq). My family and his family are also well aware of it, so if people ask they know to let them know that I am keeping my name. From my friends that have recently gotten married, most guests are not going to get you personalized things unless they are close to you, in which case I hope they know you are keeping your name!"
11967,56581,"There are no rights and wrongs for wedding size, what really matters is what you and your fiance want. Everyone has mentioned that your budget is very important and usually dictates how many people you can afford to invite, and this is so true. One thing to also consider is what do you mean by big? Are you talking about the scale of your wedding (formal, semi-formal, fancy), the number of guests invited, or the cost? My ""small"" wedding will be semi-formal and have 60-80 guests, while other people's ""small"" weddings can have as few as 2 guests and as many as 200, being both really formal all the way to really informal! When you close your eyes and imagine your wedding, what is it like? Who absolutely has to be there and you can't imagine your wedding without? I think these things are more important that throwing a splashy event. remember, you are the one that has to live with it, so go with your heart."
11978,11063,"I guess my big question is why did he want to keep it a secret from his family for so long?  I know that for me, that would be very hurtful and would make me feel like perhaps he didn't really want to be married to me if he was keeping it a secret.  What's done is done though, and you could probably start a good discussion with an apology for going behind his back.  Sincerely apologize, but that could be the opener for you to be able to discuss your frustration and reasons for doing it, and hopefully the two of you can get it all out on the table.  Good luck to you on this one, I hope that everything works out for the best and that the two of you can patch things up quickly and enjoy your newly wedded bliss  :)"

11813,26153,"My color scheme is similar...but I am doing light pink, ivory and chocolate. I think it would be pretty to put a bold color in.  I dont think that you necessarily need a vibrant one, bold is classy, and that seems like what you are looking for! :)"
11788,26153,"I think ya'll should go for it!! :) My fiance and I will be together 6 1/2 years when we get married, and will both be 22. We want babies right away.  I think ppl who say ""enjoy your marriage"" havent been together as long...My fiance and I think it's just the next step and kids are in no way a burden to us, so why not have them young? If u have been together that long, and have enjoyed ""just the two of you"" time, than I think it's a great idea!"
11813,70212,"Hi Khyrs and Mrs. Alston,

It's funny, one of you has pink and one of you has gold. Cause today while I was out I was writing notes to myself and I wrote an idea for the colors to be pink and gold...just don't know what accent yet. Maybe black or white or cream or chocolate? What do you think?"
12004,73339,"I might warn people just in case they are super allergic.  Most people probably couldn't care less that there are pets (who doesn't love pets?!?) but for the people that might be allergic it would be a nice warning.  :)"
11517,20278,"Try taking on one thing at a time.  You know it is going to be outside, in front of a barn and you have narrowed down the colors. That is a great start, use this information and go to the next step.   Make a checklist and take on one project at a time.  You can find checklists in Wedding Magazines and online.  If you know the shape and size of the tables start looking for the linens. Once you have that nailed down then start with the outdoor decorations, then the flowers, favors and so on.   For ideas, go to your local bookstore, grab all the wedding mags and sit down with your favorite beverage and take note of all the things you like and can afford.  You can get great ideas this way.  Congrats, and good luck Cara!"
11989,69470,"Hi Joanna,
Maybe you could just let your parent's neighbor know how much you appreciate their generosity and ask if there is anything you can do to help. That will open the dialog to find out if she's expecting help with the costs. If she doesn't accept your help monetarily, remember to give her a nice thank you gift.

Hope that helps!

11981,38515,"I would try and pay at least the deposits with a credit card. Most credit cards have kind of like a service protection type thing so that if one of your vendors mess up, the credit card company will fight the charges for you and it's also a great way to keep track of your spending. As for paying the final balance in cash, it depends on the place, I have to pay all my stuff at least 10 days before and for any extra charges that might pop up, I would pay after. And the tipping thing, some wedding sites/books/magz say you don't have to, some say you should. I'm looking at it like going out to dinner, if the service is above and beyond, I would give a good tip, if the service sucks or isn't what you wanted, I wouldn't tip at all. Good Luck!"
12004,62793,"Is the reception inside or out?  I think if it's outside in a tent, there's no need to mention it.  However, if it's inside, I would most definitely mention it.  Pet allergies are very common, and you don't want someone going into anaphylactic shock or having an asthma attack."
11989,62793,"I think that you should definitely ask if you can pay for something... perhaps you could offer to buy the vodka and champagne for bloody mary's and mimosas.  If people are hung over, I'm sure they'll appreciate the ""hair of the dog.""  You probably won't need more than a couple of big bottles of Absolut or Skyy and 5 - 10 bottles of champagne (which you can get at Costco fairly cheaply... no one will mind Moet or Mumms champagne mixed w/ OJ).  Total cost may be $150, and you don't feel like you're taking advantage of your neighbor's generosity.  Plus, she may offer to pick the whole thing up as a wedding gift in the end."
11984,71634,"I just heard an awesome song this weekend at a wedding by Steven Curtis Chapman, called Cinderella.  It was touching for sure. "
11994,67710,"1 & 2) If you are the type of couple that enjoys dancing and your guest too, DJ's are a lot of fun! All the weddings I have been to with a DJ always have a good flow because you have someone directing the events and MC'ing to give guest guidance and keeping things fun. 
3) An alternative is to rent music equipment to hook a mp3 player up too. You can put all the songs that you would like and have a friend or family member work it.
4) If you have a reception hall I would book a DJ because they work well in that type of atmosphere and the reasons I mentioned above. I am going to have a band, but that is because we will have a smaller venue and it is a restaurant. 

It all depends on your taste and what you want for your wedding. Good luck in your decision.
"
11989,67710,"I agree with the other two. You should tell her how much you appreciate her offer and see if there is anything you can do to help. If she needs your help I am sure she will let you know, and if she doesn't you could at least offer to bring a dessert and a nice thank you gift."
12060,67710,"A MC gives guidance through the reception and announces the events of the reception. (i.e. cake cutting, first dance, bouquet toss) An MC is great to have to keep everything flowing and organized, but doesn't have to be necessary. I hope that helps!"

12059,56581,"According to your profile, your wedding is going to be in Hawaii, how wonderful!!!!!! Do I think any guests would complain or feel strangely about a brunch on the beach in Hawaii? NO WAY!!! How many people can even say that they have been to a brunch on the beach in Hawaii. I think it would add to the specialness of your wedding getaway and be a wonderful time with your guests. The beach in Hawaii is way more memorable than any restaurants...  Go for it!!!!!"
11786,74945,"All I will say is ....  you buy cheap you get cheap

if you want quality (AS I will be doing)  get a Professional then they know how to be a Dj, do MC (as I have been now told) and do all the things a Professional can do"
12060,56581,"Like the previous poster said the MC usually helps keep your reception flowing. A lot of the time, if you have a DJ or band leader, that person would serve as your MC. If you have an energetic or entertaining person that you know likes to ham it up, you could always ask that person to be your MC... Is it absolutely necessary? I don't think so, but having an MC keeps everyone i the loop."
11908,68442,"We use many different techniques to cover tent poles that look rather industrial.  

Flower Covered Poles: We use sections of thin chicken wire wrapped around the poles.  Then we add greenery in the holes to cover the entire pole. Layering several different types of greenery such as seeded eucalyptus, salal, and plumosa looks the best. Add flowers and/or berries in the same fashion.  You can add as many or as few flowers as you like.  This does take alot of time to complete but the end result is stunning.

Fabric Covered Poles:  Use stripes of fabric and wrap diagonally with the raw edges turned under to give a shirring affect.  You can go back over top of the fabric and accessorize with hanging crystals, broaches, pretty enbroidered trim, colored ribbon and so on.  The options are endless.  Once we covered a pole with sand colored fabric then added star fish and shells.  

Another favorite we accented the pole with grape vine and clusters of grapes for a Tuscan feel.
"
11813,68442,"Color choice is very personal and subjective.  I find it helpful to  also consider how it will photograph.  After all you have to look at the photographic memories for the next 50 years.  When I design I take into consideration of color representation.  Often, all that is needed is a small colorful bloom to give a little punch.  

Search out wedding photos that stand out to you, especially group shots with the wedding party, if they are more vibrant in color than you may want to consider adding more.

I also find that whether you choose subtle shades or vibrant, it's the photographer who can all the difference.  How he takes the shot, in what type of lighting and how he stages the photo will play into the picture.  For my brides who are using softer shades I suggest they chat with their photographer so they can be prepared.
"
12063,67772,"I agree with your friends, you only wear it once.  It is VERY improtant that you feel wonderful though, so were there any other dresses that you saw that looked similar to that dress? I know David's Bridal mimics a lot fo their gowns off of designer gowns, so you can probably find somethign that looks nice there.  If you MUST have the dress, then i definitely suggest you scale back in other areas & see if you can get one of those deals where the groom gets to rent his tu for free...that's what we are doing to save some $.  Here are some suggestions to save:
~make your own centerpieces & bouquets (I'm doing it, it'll be fun!)
~get nice but inexpensive favors - most people throw them away anyways
~get only 1 limo for you & BMs to get to the ceremony, then have them ride with GMs to the reception & you & your hubby ride in the limo to the reception
~get nice but inexpensive shoes
~find photo/video ametures or students, maybe someone who has shot @ least 1-5 weddings before
Good luck"
12060,67772,"Stands for master of ceremonies. I am getting one b/c I don't want any of my guests having to worry about doing anything on the day of the wedding...our MC is actually our DJ as well. Having one will allow us to direct the guests' attention to the various activities througout the night!"
11994,67772,"1: Someone who plays & mixes music & hypes up people to dance.
2: If you want your wedding to be more like a party (as opposed to a dinner) and have someone to hype the guests & get them dancing then a DJ is a good way to get them to be interactive & dance, etc.  Also, he can serve as master of ceremonies to direct guests attn to activities during the reception such as bouquet toss, cake cutting, etc. I wouldn't hrie one if I was on a really tight bdget or was having a really informal reception (like a back yard party).
3: Esp. if your on a tight budget you can load up your I-pod (hook it up to big speakers, whcih you would probably have to rent) with tunes you'd wanna hear & have them shuffle during the reception. If u do this, I would make sure to have someone be in charge of it so they can select the specific songs 4 1st dance, father/daughter dance, etc.
4: We are hiring a DJ so that we have someone making sure the night runs smooth & every has a good time & DANCES!!"
11981,67772,"If our vendors took credit cards, then we booked them on those...btw, I put it on my card that has points on it...good way to earn points & just use your wedding svaings to pay that amount off of your card.

Our photog & videographer didn't take cards so we paid our deposits with checks to them & had them send us a receipt.

The tipping thing bothers me, if I tip people, it's not gonna be that much...like $20.  Most vendors are already gettign a lot of $.  I will probably tip the DJ, my caterer includes gratuity in their bill, hair stylist, limo guy (that is also included I believe). We are also feeding all our vendors so 2 me that's anothe rpart fo their tip...lol.  I hate to be like that but weddings are already SO expensive w/o adding unneccessary fees to stuff."
12065,26876,"I have not, but I can say that I can understand why they would say that. It would be hipocracy(sp) for them to do that. It would be kinda hard to preach on Sunday about fornication, and then marry someone who you know has done it next Sat. It may seem wrong, like what do they care what you do at home. Its not that they care as much as they feel that it would be wrong to perform a marriage that does not comply completely with the Christian faith. Do you understand? I don't think that you really need to answer to anyone anyway, only to GOD. Its kinda hard to talk about this subject, knowing that there will be so many people here that will tell you differently, but Im a Christian I go to church Every Sunday and try to live like a Christian daily. If you'd like I can tell you more on this, just send me a message. I hope it doesn't sound offensive, but thats they way things are. "
12063,26876,"Try going to other stores, you may find that another dress may be the one of your dreams. I think that having to sacrifice in other areas of your wedding for a dress is not a good idea. You want to make the most of your wedding not the dress. And  yes you do only wear it once. My cousin tried to spend $8000 on a stupid dress, and I say stupid because there was nothing special about it only the tag that had whatever designers name on it. Its a good thing I talked her out of it, because she got pregnant and ended up eloping. Im not saying thats going to you. Try going to different stores, there are thousands and thousands of dresses our there, there has to be more than one you really like. "
12059,26876,"I'd only be concerned if it gets windy, there is nothing more annoying than having sand on your food. I think it sounds like a great idea other than that. Oh and if there are any seagulls, you might expect them to be around."
11981,61169,"Paying your vendors varies with each vendor.   With caterers, they usually take an initial deposit by check or credit card and then break down the remainder into segments.   I always advise my clients to pay all of the vendors before the wedding day.   The last thing you need to thin about that day is money.   I have never heard of a caterer taking cash the day of.   They want to be paid at least 10 days before the wedding.   If someone does insist on payment the day of, such as an officiant of DJ, I have the bride give it to me in an envelope and I take care of it quietly.   Tipping is up to you.   Always check with the caterer about the gratuity for the staff- is it included in the cost or added to it?   If there are valets, limo drivers or coat checks, they need to be tipped.  Otherwise, tip as you see fit.   Thank you notes to vendors are always appreciated.   Good luck with your wedding plans!          "
12067,67772,"I think you could still have them a Jr. BMs, there are no rules governing how many attendants you can have.  If you don't want them to be Jr. BMs, maybe you can have them read a poem about love or be hostesses who hand out programs & oversee the guest book @ the ceremony.

Definitely mention them in your programs, include them in pics, have their names announced with the rest of the bridal party @ the reception during the introductions, and give them corsages or boutineers so they feel special & included!"
11818,62716,"I am actually not using flowers for my centerpieces either. I had one idea to use large round glass containers (can get at any dollar store) with a tall slender candle to sit down into the bowl. Then fill the jar (around the candle) about half way with round glass marble pieces. Add water around the candle on the marble pieces to about 2 inches from the top of the candle. When you light the candle it looks amazing. I came up with this idea when I was on the Prom committee in High School and it worked really well and looked very unique and nice.

12061,36988,"Congratulations on your engagement!

My suggestion would be to start by developing your budget.  Once you know how much you can spend, you will be all set to start planning!  Typically, you will then choose your wedding date and ceremony and reception venues.

Good Luck!"
11747,36988,"Don't get overwhelmed, it is possible!  Figure out your budget and spend your money on things that are most important to you.  Although your friends and family may not be able to support you financially, maybe they can give you their time instead.  I'm sure they would be willing to help you with some DIY projects.

Good Luck!!
"
11569,36988,"There is nothing wrong with having an uneven bridal party - it's just personal preference.  If these are the people that you want to stand up with you on your special day, then you should have them all there.  You don't have to stress yourself out by asking someone to step down.  To be honest, no one will be looking at your bridal party during the ceremony, they will be looking at you and your groom!

Good Luck!

12067,64143,"I agree with the previous answer, but wanted to caution you regarding candles outside.  The slightest breeze blows them out!  You need to either use a hurricane glass over them or consider using a sand ceremony."
11642,62304,"Hi, Melissa. I'm getting married in May 2009 in Philly. The best place I've found so far is Penns Landing Caterers which is located on Columbus Blvd. The ceremony & reception, food and cake is all being done by them. You can go to there website pennslandingcaterers.com . I think that's the way it's spelled. LOL! Good luck!!!!!!1"
11981,74467,"It is always better to pay with a method that gives you some sort of protection. There are many good vendors that do not take credit cards. In those cases it would be better to pay by check than cash. I would recommend paying cash only if you could immediately get a receipt. Even when paying by check, you should still receive a receipt for your payment. A cashed check can be used as a proof of payment, if you you lose your receipt. 

Those checks that you receive from credit card companies are another option for paying vendors that do not accept credit cards. This may even give you some of the benefits of the credit card."
12063,46106,"You can try checking online for the same dress.  You wouldn't believe what you can find on ebay.

Personally, I'd splurge on the dress if it's definitely ""the one.""  I'd rather have fewer flowers and feel like an absolute princess."
11982,74467,"It is your wedding day, you should do what is going to make the two of you the happiest that day. If all that you want is an intimate wedding with just your immediate families and closest friends, then that's is what you should plan.

When you send out the invitations for the people you want to come to only the reception, don't even mention the location of the ceremony.
You might say something along the lines of: Please share in the celebration of our love and marriage by joining us in a reception at...

If someone should ask you about the ceremony, you can tell them you are just having an intimate ceremony with your immediate families and leave it at that. Avoid giving any paticulars of time or place, unless you want them to show up at the ceremony.

There probably will be people that would like to go to the ceremony that won't be invited. But, remember that the day is for the two of you to happily profess your love. If too many people make you nervous, just look at each other."
12081,62793,"I suppose that depends on your budget.  I am having a destination wedding where everyone will be out of town, but I'm not giving everyone a gift basket.  I am doing a nice favor, but that's it.  I think that if you do one or the other, that's fine... I don't think guests will expect both.  But if your budget is limitless, why not!"
12066,36988,"One guest book should be fine.  I would suggest that you designate a friend or family member to be responsible for bringing the book from the ceremony site to the reception.

Good luck with everything!!
"
11952,61177,"I don't agree that it is something that you should put on the invitation.  Will you also put on the invite that you don't like the color blue and don't cook, etc.?

I am all for keeping your own name, but a lot of people will think of you as a ""Mrs."" just for the weddding and you never know...you may enjoy being a ""Mrs."" part of the time.  Using those Mr. & Mrs. monogrammed towels could be fun when you're alone!"
12088,26051,"it is not ok to ask anyone other than the bridal party to pay for the showers.  If you are hosting a party/shower you do not ask guests to pay for it, typically the bridal party splits the cost.

as far as the bach/bachelorette parties i think that is fair to split the cost between all people that are going, as that is typically more of a night out"

instead she went with bucca de beppo and everything was delicious."
12088,75168,"what if they are given the title of HOST & part of the money ($30 for the Bridal shower, $50 for the Couples shower, $35 for the 2 nite Bach party) is put toward the gift for the Bride & Groom"
12060,65478,"Congratulations on your engagement!

The prior posts were correct in the definition of MC. However, somethings the wedding coordinator will be asked to MC instead of the DJ.

Best Wishes!"
12088,26876,"It really doesn't seem very polite to ask your guests of those parties to have to pay. Im pretty sure you may get a lot of no shows. It doesn't matter how the money will be spent or where its going towards. "
12090,26876,"It really depends on where you go or who does it for you. I've seen a lot of places charge around $75. Usually the brides make-up is a little more than the bridesmaids...I dunno why. My friend is a beautician and she normally charges around $60 depending on what they're getting done. It may seem a little steep, but she also includes a touch-up kit to take with you and apply when needed. I think you should do some more research, and yeah if you were told you were getting all that and got none of it, you have a right to complain. Then again nothing is in writting, but that seems a little steep...$85."
12063,53299,"Yes you do only wear it once, but you have the pictures forever and I dont think you want to look back and say ""I wish I had that dress"". I bought practically the first dress I tried on. I just knew that it was the one, I knew that my FH would LOVE it, but i spent WAY to much on it. But in my eyes it will be worth it in the end to see his face as I am walking down the isle. 

My advise to you is: GO WITH YOUR GUT!!!!"
12090,11063,"I never did look into the cost of make-up in my area seriously, but I had seen a couple of quotes online that also seemed very steep to me.  I decided to instead go to the department store and have them do my make-up for me.  She showed me how to do it, etc., and I bought all of the make-up.  I spent $135 for all of the make-up, but at least I can keep it and re-use it over and over.  My skill at my make-up is not as good as the cosmetologist, but it's not bad and it still looks more like me.  I think calling the manager to complain is a good idea if you're unhappy with it, but check first to see who told you that you were getting airbrush, etc., to make sure that it wasn't a misunderstanding."
12088,11063,"In my humble opinion, it is never ok to ask for folks to pay for your showers.  Really, because you're the bride and you're not hosting any of these parties, you shouldn't be in on any of the money discussions anyway.  Your wedding party or friends or whoever is throwing the parties for you will figure out the finances, and usually they're happy to pay for it to help you celebrate your special day.  When my best friend got married, her cousin hosted her bachelorette party.  She asked everyone coming to contribute $60 for the evening.  I felt this was pretty steep, and so I asked her what was up when I called to RSVP.  She then explained that she knew it was expensive, but it covered dinner, drinks, and we were getting a party bus for the night.  Also, it was so that the bride and her mother would not have to contribute.  In that case, I was more than happy to contribute.  The bride knew nothing about it, and still doesn't, as it should be."
12096,65478,"Congratulations on your engagement!

Start by writing what comes from your heart. Write down all the things that you love about each other. There are many guides that you can find on the internet to get help writing your vows. Also, the library has several books on the subject. Some couples also use a favorite poem.

Best Wishes."

This should all be discussed in the consultation with your entertainment (if not be sure to bring it up).

12096,26876,"Also, you can also use the internet and get ideas from there. What I did at first was I had a my sisters ask me about my feelings for him, like why do I love him, or what do i look forward the most. They wrote down everything i said, and then I used that to help me come up with my vows. "
12081,26876,"When you say out of town you mean you have people traveling from far distances and staying overnight or just a couple of hours. I think if there are people flying in and staying in a hotel, it might be a nice gesture. I mean although its their choice to come or not they made a sacrifice to come to your wedding, and even a bottle of wine or something would be a nice. So I would say if they are taking a plane or driving from a far away I would, it doesnt have to be something fancy. "
12103,55641,"We are only inviting couples who are married, engaged, or have been in a serious relationship for over a year, since we are also having a smaller wedding.

Also, the invitations will specify names, and not include ""and guest"". Hopefully people will understand that this means that if their significant other is unable to come, they cannot bring a random other person."
12103,26876,"I think it'll be ok if you just address the invite with only your co-workers name on them. I think they will understand if you don't invite their bf/gf, and if a group of your co-workers come to the wedding its not like they wont have anyone to talk to. And if they have a problem with you not inviting their significant other than they may not come, and that should be ok too. "

So make your very good friends feel important and have fun with it.
We got married and I had the same debate and was wanting a wedding and party and didn't want to dissapoint my close friends. 
You know We decided to have a very private and quite ceremony with just our best man maid of honor and us and then we all went to a nice resturant and then went dancing. 
It was great!!!! Better than ever spending way to much money and going into debt. My maid of honor said she hadn't had that much fun since we were teenagers.. So you set the pace and the rest will follow. Remember it is your day and they will make it special and enjoy it also .. Congratulations and many great years to the two of you.

You have nothing to apologize for."
11527,37378,"Tanya,
Yes I think 60 is way out there. 20 to 25 is the most even for a big beautiful boquet. Store in Fridge.... they will last and look great.
Also most florists now adays know how to preserve your bouquet so it would still look good 30 years from now. You could also go to a hobby store and they can give you some good ideas on how to preserve and they have product that you can buy to do this .. its easy..
Make sure you check and get good roses if that is what your planning on using.. There is a differenc in how big the bud will be and how long they will last. Go for the african rose it comes in many different colors and is strong and will last. It is a bigger bud and looks like a high dollar bouquet. 
Granted they are not as cheap as regular roses but if you have seen pics of big bouquets in magazines this is what most use.

11633,55641,"I feel like I am missing something here. Wouldn't it make sense to just not send invitations to more than 100 people if that is your limit?

We have limited space as well, and therefore have an A-List and a B-List for invites. The A-List includes the people we MUST have there, and the B-List is for people we would LIKE to have there. The A-List invites will go out first, and if people from the A-List decline, we will invite people from the B-List."

I am a event planner and feel that if you have not got a break down in price this is a bad place to be. Your planner should be at your beck and call. I answer my phone 24 hrs a day.. 
I would not be in buisness if I did not take care of my bride and grooms. 
I also hope you have a contract. Other wise you may not have a leg to stand on. Go thru it and if she is not filling her obligations then she owes you not you owe her. 
So see what you can do.
Let me know and take care"

It has indoor and outdoor accommodations, sits right on the water, and they do their own catering.

I'm sure if you Google it you can find out much more.

LYRICS

I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath - it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue

This, unfortunately, can seriously cut down the rest of the guest list.... But if I were going to someone's wedding, I wouldn't want Jeremy to be excluded, so it does make sense. ""And guest"" is too informal though. Use specific names. If you can't, just invite the one person."

And I'll only do that for half the song and then bring everyone else onto the dance floor to join them. At my brother's wedding I didn't even get a chance to slow dance with my fiancee because she had the bridal party dance with only the bridal party and then the money dance and so on and that was it for slow dances.  I want my guests to enjoy all the dancing as well."
12081,56581,"I am planning on doing welcome baskets for my out of town guests because I think it'll be a nice gesture, but every individual guest is not getting a basket, I am giving one per party--like one per couple or family. This will help keep the costs down but still include them all. If you can do something similar, I think your guests would really appreciate it!"
11978,70212,"Hi again,

I agree with the other brides who suggest you apologize. Referring to his behavior as childish is not understanding and will not help your relationship.

Sure he's got some issues regarding his mother which made him want to wait way too long to tell her. But a completely different issue is that you betrayed his trust and crossed boundaries which was not your place to do. That is what you need to apologize for.

"
12103,70212,"I always make it a policy to give a single adult over 21 the option of bringing a guest. Not only is it the stated thing to do in the etiquette books, it's just nice.

I actually wound up getting into a fight with my cousin before her wedding when I was 37 and she wouldn't invite me with a guest. I happened to be dating someone for seven months at the time, but even if I weren't it's just the elegant thing to do.

Now-a-days a lot of people don't to save money, but it's tacky, especially when the single has a steady girlfriend or boyfriend. 

I say let them bring their partner."

11989,75606,"You and your family are blessed with such a good friend and neighbor. Ask if there is anything you can do to help and do remember to write her a big thank you. This may be her gift to you for the wedding and if so it is such a wonderful gesture. "
12063,75606,"If you feel like a million dollars why not get it, but think of all the ways you can. Ask the store if you can make payments on the dress, do they have any credit card deals going on now or in the near future such as 12 months no interest or same as cash? These are some of the ways. You could cut back on other things yes, but it's your day. Work with the store or search for the dress somewhere else that does offer better deals to allow you to purchase it. Good luck!"
12115,26876,"This is another one those no right or wrong answer questions. It can start off with the introducing the mr and mrs and wedding party, and then the first dance, or can hold off on the dance and eat, then dance. Toasts can either be done after cutting the cake, or Ive seen it done during the dinner. I mean it really can go anyway you want it to. If you have an wedding planner or event captain at  your reception venue they can work with you to come up with a plan to fit your needs. Personally, I held off on the dance till after dinner, just because I knew people would be hungry and so were we and also because we had a firt dance that was interupted by a fast merengue song that my whole party joined in on. It made more sense that way. "

12115,41195,"Thats right there are no right or wrong answers. Your reception is uniquely the two of you!
Your wedding consultant will sometimes work with you to create a timeline given to all your vendors.
Most times this is left up to the entertainment. If I am djing this is the format I like to follow,(personalized/modified during our consultation):
Formal introductions
First Dance
Father/Daughter dance
Mother/Son dance
Toast(s)
Meal
Cake Cutting
Open dancing
Bouqet and garter toss
Open dancing
Last dance 
Send off
The reason I do the traditonal events in the begining is so the photographer and or videographer can get shots while everyone is still 
dressed up. Then when the meal is served they can loosen up for the open dancing and activities later.
During the consultation with my clients I will go over the timeline by the wedding coordinator or create one with them.

Please feel free to email with any questions!


"
12130,56581,"I don't think that you HAVE to give your step daughter and your FSIL a gift, especially considering that you are helping to pay for the wedding. But if you want to give them a gift (anything ranging from a small token of your love to a major purchase), give something from the heart. I'm sure they will be getting all the hand towels that they need, so they would really appreciate something with sentimental value. My best friend and her husband got a decorative marriage certificate box from his parents as a gift, and they loved the idea of keeping their marriage certificate in a special place from a special person."
4133,21053,"Thank you - however, we have found a bagpiper - our wedding is now less than 5 weeks away. But maybe someone else can use your services? "
12067,677,"Marie, I'd encourage you to have them in the wedding party/ceremony. As mentioned, they can be Jr. Bridesmaids, candle lighters, or train bearers. Whatever role you give them, remember that they lack some dexterity at that age. So, make sure they practice several times (and not just at your rehearsal) with their job, especially if you are going to have them light candles and then replace a hurricane globe and because they will use a lighter with which they are probably no familiar. :)

Don't be afraid to get creative, either. They can pull your flowergirl/ringbearer down the aisle in a little red wagon decorated for the wedding. They can walk the aisle together and then each take a spot on your/his sides of the altar area (which might keep the balance you seem to desire). And, ""lop sided"" parties are all the rage, now.

Kids that age want so badly to be helpful. So, be sure you find a way to make their role important.

As You Wish photography"
11989,677,"I agree with what has been said: be sure you do a really nice gift for them (perhaps a gift certificate for a nice dinner out) to make up for such a generous hosting. And, be sure you and your new hubby raise a glass of mimosa to toast them at the brunch...and thank them for taking care of everyone on the day after. ;)"
11084,57763,"I have been doing a lot of reseach on this, here is a good list of locations here http://www.allweddingcompanies.com/decorations/butterflies/index.html

By law no company can ship butterflies into a state where they threaten other species so no worries there.  And all the companies i have looked at guarantee 100% live delivery - enjoy!"
12081,67733,"This will depend on your budget that you have set for gift baskets. With half of your guests coming from out of town it could get expensive depending on the caliber of basket you are trying to create. If it's really important for you to give something to everyone you can maybe do something on a smaller scale. You can do an itinerary of the weekend, a map or listing of things in the area, and a small treat of some kind. It is best to create one per family or couple. Hope this helps."
12067,67733,"If you are having a sign in or guest book table you can utilize them to assist with that. Also, if you are passing out programs that is a great way to include children. Usually anything you assign kids to they are thrilled to be involved. They like to feel like they have an important role and if you find some way to thank them with a small gift they are appreciative. Hope this helps."
11147,67733,"Depending on your outdoor location, you may just want to purchase a ready made white tulle canopy that you can hang over the cake. I've seen them at IKEA and Anna's Linens. This will give you a whimiscal look as well as protect your cake from unwanted critters. Best of luck!"

12130,26876,"I dont think a gift is expected from them, especially if your are contributing financially. My parents and MIL helped us out so much. As long as you are there emotionally, financially and physically(to help) than you are straight. Its really up to you, but dont feel obligated to."
12146,26876,"For my bouquet I used Black magic roses, they were a deep red and depending on the light it would sort of look black, not your typical rose. I also used stephanotis in between the roses with pearls in them. Theres a picture of it on my profile. For the girls i had white eskimo roses with red gerbra daisies, the middle of them sort of looks black, so it went well with my b/w and red theme. I also used red and white Gladiolas for altar arrangments. You know there is such thing as black tulips, you might want to look into that, they look so awesome."
12146,59286,"Depending on the colors you'd like to have in your bouquet you can do a mix of the callas and roses, both come in a wide range of colors, and look fabulous together. If you'd like any other ideas please feel free to contact us and we'd be glad to send you a list of them.

12146,62458,"Well, I have a bride who is using the exact same colors as you are.  Her bouquet will be red roses and white callas.  The men will wear calla lilly bouts.  The bridesmaids will carry all red bouquets of mixed flowers which will include roses and red hypericum berries.  

If you don't want to use too many roses, try ranunculus, they look alot like roses.  You could also mix red and white callas.  Red orchids are pretty also if you want to go for something more exotic.  How do you feel about peonies?  They are very full and it would take less of those to make a bouquet.  

Good luck!"
12063,62458,"If you know who the designer of the dress is, go to www.netbride.com and get a quote on the dress.  They are very reasonable and customer service is great.  I've had several brides to use them because they are so much cheaper than the bridal shops on the exact same dress.  Another option is to hire a seamstress who might be able to make you the same dress cheaper."
11909,11063,"Getting a bustle put on your dress is pretty simple and inexpensive if you take it to a seamstress.  The cost and the amount of hooks necessary will depend on the length and weight of your train.  At my first wedding, my train was very long and heavy, so I had five or seven bustle points (I don't remember!).  On my dress for my upcoming wedding, my train is considerably shorter and is a lot lighter, so I only need one.  It's costing me $25 to have the bustle put in.  It's money well spent, and still a lot cheaper than getting a different dress!  Good luck with whatever you decide  :)"
11987,62458,"There's a wonderful resort and spa there called Kings Mill.  If you want to be pampered, that's the place to go!  Additionally, you won't be too far from the beach or from Richmond where there are other attractions to see."
11191,48324,"I am having 2 MOH's.  My sister and my best friend that I have known for 11 years.  What I was worried about though was who was going to be standing next to me.  That is how most people figure out who the MOH is.  Well, my niece is my flower girl and she will be too young to walk down alone, so my sister (her mother) will have to walk with her and since that is right before I walk down...that kinda took care of its self.  I think it's really the only downside to having more than 1 MOH.
"
12060,76013,"An MC, or Master of Ceremonies (also called an emcee), is responsible for the announcements and introductions.  He/She usually coordinates the events of the wedding/event with other professionals (caterer, photographer, videographer, venue representatives, etc.) to assure that everything goes smoothly during the wedding/event.
Having your DJ as the MC is a plus.  Often the DJ has had professional voice training (ask if he/she has done voice-overs, commercials, or has on-air experience, or simply TALK with him/her to see what the sound of the voice is.  Pleasant?  Easy to listen to?  Authoritative?).  Additionally, many announcements/intros are done while music is playing.  The DJ will be able to control the volume of the music during those announcements/intros so that it is properly in the background and timed properly for the announcement/intro.
Furthermore, if you are using your DJ's microphone for toasts, etc. he/she can give instructions on how to use it."
12115,76013,"As has already been said, your reception can be any way you want it to be!  I tell my clients, ""Do exactly what YOU want to do, and don't feel you have to take advice from anyone, including me!""  :)

In my experience, the ""usual"" order of events in a reception is:

12154,50366,"You can invite whomever you want.  I think it would be a nice gesture, because they probably would like to share in the fun!  Also, if they are going to be walking down the isle at a specific time, you will want them there to let them know what they need to do.  "
12151,50366,"Sometimes grandparents have a specific time that they are to walk down the isle (just prior to the parents of the bride and groom.  So it would be helpful for them to be there.  Also, they would enjoy be included.

11987,76013,"My wife and I went to Williamsburg for a quick vacation this past October.  Before we went, we purchased an ""Independence Pass"" and made our lodging reservations on line.  Colonial Williamsburg has a VERY helpful web site that explains the differences among the passes offered, the lodging combinations (we stayed off property at the Hampton, which is just a few blocks away), and all of the programs offered during the days and evenings.
I highly recommend getting the Independence Pass.  It will pay for itself if you go to several evening programs, and the admission prices for all the other venues on property (such as the Governor's Mansion, etc.) are included. 
I also recommend that you look over the evening programs and decide which ones you want to do ASAP.  Then make the reservations immediately, as the tours fill up quickly, sometimes months in advance.  Also, if you want a great dinner at Christiana Campbell's (great!) make reservations months in advance!
Have a great time!"
11984,76013,"I love SKimbell's suggestion of ""A Whole New World"" from Aladdin (sung by Peabo Bryson).  The words are perfect, and since it is from a ""children's movie,"" it works for you daughter as well.

A great way to get around to that topic with her might be to rent the video and watch it with her.  When the song plays in the movie, your fiancé could dance around the room with her playfully, and then after the movie, you could suggest that it might be a good song for the wedding reception.  That way, she will feel more comfortable with the song and with the idea of dancing to that song with your fiancé.  It will also give you a good look at how easily she will relate to the idea of dancing with him (which you haven't mentioned, but which I assume is not going to be a problem.)"
11665,76013,"I've done MANY weddings where there are just Maid/Matron of Honor and the Best Man as attendants.  No one thinks twice about it.  
I've also done weddings where there were 12 or more bridesmaids, each matched with a groomsman, etc., and I never heard anyone say, ""Wow... they must have a lot of friends!""  :)
Most of the time, the comment was about how much it cost the bridal party to buy the dresses!  ;)
So relax!  It's YOUR wedding.  Do what you want and enjoy!"

11952,69121,"As someone pointed out earlier, people close to you will know that you're not changing your name and anyone who isn't close to you will probably not go further than getting you something that just says ""Mr."" and ""Mrs."" with no name at all since it takes thought and energy to get his last name embroidered in.  I'm not changing my last name either and I'll probably take the advice of someone who posted a comment earlier about incorporating that into the website somehow.  I'm gonna have my guests RSVP for the wedding on the website so hopefully they'll see it :)  Good luck!"

12201,67772,"I def would say stay away from blue flowers which tend to be closer to purple.  I think white flowers that have a lot of light green in them would be pretty - ranunculas (sp?), gladilous, green hydrangeas, green cybidium orchids, etc.  I think these would be pretty & simple, then you could tie the flowers with a ribbon the same color as your tropic wedding color.

11974,36988,"Is there anything that you might be willing let your mom handle?  It doesn't have to be (and probably shouldn't be) a major decision, but it could be something simple.  Maybe if you give a little, she'll step back a little.  Just a thought!

11982,48751,"My sister had a small ceremony(with ONLY family, between 30 and 40 ppl)at an old church near my parents farm.  At the reception (on the farm) they had a video of the ceremony played so that no one felt left out.  It was pretty neat-the guests loved it and she got the small, intimate ceremony she wanted."
12096,48751,"There are lots of websites and books you can use for ideas, but I feel when writing your own vows, just think of why you are getting married, how/why you love each other now, and the promises you wish to make to each other to make your marriage great.  We also took some parts of friends' vows that we really liked and wanted as part of our own.  "
12151,48751,"It is my understanding that all family and (usually) out of town guests are invited to the rehearsal dinner.  If your grandparents are walking down the aisle (as the previous poster mentioned) they need to be at the rehearsal AND the dinner.  "

My Fiance and I love to talk about having kids and we been dating for 3 years. We might wait for about 2 years but if they come a year earlier it doesnt matter. His parents had kids less than a year they were married and they been together for 30 years.

So do whats best for you and your husband. Congrats and good luck!"
12208,48751,"My sister got married in a very small chapel (it can seat about 50).  Her husband alone has 11 brothers and sisters, and our whole family is large also. Her total guest list was close to 250 so she only invited family (extended included) to the Ceremony and then had a video of the Ceremony played at the Reception so everyone still felt included.  Then they stood with the pastor at the ceremony and re-stated their vows.  It was a quick 15-20 minutes at the Reception and everyone loved it."

10158,43575,"I agree with everyone. Its a little weird and I would have a talk with Matt. Make sure you dont corner him and blame his parents. He might take it the wrong way if you talk ""mean"" about his mother. Most boys are mommy boys and moms are super protective of their ""little"" boys."

12201,56581,"For my best friend's wedding, her main color was David Bridal's ""pool"" which I think is close to the color your are describing. Our bouquets were made up of different whites and hints of yellows: white and cream roses, white gerbera daisies, little yellow flowers (maybe daffodils?), and filler. The only hint of pool was the ribbon. I think a few calla lily stems tied with tropic and black ribbon would be breath taking! You can also add accents of black using black pearls in the bouquets.

11981,76013,"I'm a DJ, and I send out a contract that requests the deposit in check or money order form by return mail.  

Many of the DJs I know want the remainder of their payment in cash or check prior to the reception.  Those who don't require full payment prior to the reception require cash payments at the reception.  

Personally, I allow payment by check on the night of the reception.  I'm not worried about ""getting stiffed"" by someone who might cancel the check.  It hasn't happened in 28 years, and I don't expect it to happen now.  

Check with each vendor to find out what their requirements are.  Those should be spelled out in the contract.

I rarely get tipped as a DJ, but I frequently get a ""rave"" review a week or so after the honeymoon.  It's nice to get those notes.  Tips, by the way, have ranged from $20.00 to $80.00, but I don't really expect it."
12201,27993,"Green Cymbidium Orchids with white Calla Lilies  black ribbon against the tropic dresses???  I say white flowers, unless you do not want white...BLACK FLOWERS 
Black is all abouL mystery and stability but also undiscovered potential. Long associated with power, black is formal, elegant and prestigious. Now a days it is the 'color' of choice for designers.


BLACK FLOWERS
Nature has produced no black flowers but flowers that appear black appeal powerfully to our imaginations -'Black Beauty 1 roses and 'Queen of Night 1 tulips are classic examples.

However, flowers that naturally come in black are Pansies, Roses, Tulip, Lilies, Kangaroo Paw, Iris, & Begonia.
the black calla lilies are beautiful. id go with those.

Some ideas...


Ask your florist to paint them black if they are not quite black enough. 
"
12226,76013,"Anything is possible!  :)

The only caveat is that you should figure out what to do with parents.  Since your fiancé's father will be the best man, then you're in good shape.  If your father will dance with his mother, then you're in business!

Discuss the arrangement with everyone who will be affected and make sure they are all OK with it.  That way there are no unexpected problems."
12154,27993,"Yes, If you would rather not, don't, if your love wants them there invite them. If not do not. Your wedding can come with all sorts of choices and honoring your love as you enter into marrige with working together on desision making is a good way to approach your changing relationship.. Be easy going whenever possible."
12151,27993,"Invite who you like. The groom usually does the inviting and arranging of the rehersal dinner, rehersal plans from caterer, resturant choice to invitations of the minister/officiate. It is always best to cater to the elders in the kindest ways possible. Ask one of your cousins, good friends, or close family members to befriend each elder for the wedding week."

12090,50195,"Hi Tracy!
I am a makeup artist myself, so here is you some help. 
The price you are charged for the makeup is really depending on what kind of products the artist use, experience and if the service is on location or at a studio. Usually to get the make up done at a studio it might be a lot cheaper, but again... most brides want a on site service because is much more convenient. Also, in order to the makeup last you need to have good products, not just technique. So that's where you get some pricee artists. To become a makeup artist it takes a lot of practice, school e passion. And It is not cheap, therefore to get the makeup done it won't be either. But you shouldn't pay a fortune either. What I would recommend for next time is to really make things clear w/ the artist(always, always ask for a contract) an get a trial done. No doubt.
If the artist doens't fulfill your expectations...find another one. But make sure that things are the way you want and that YOU are completeley happy."
12096,27993,"I write wedding vows often as I am an officiate. The day of my wedding came and I still was not able to write my own vows 10 mins before the ceremony my husband showed me his and I copied what he said.They were short simple cute and funny everyone cried and several laughed at the funny rhyme it made when I said mine.My husband is a writer and I write ceremonies all the time. When it came to my own ceremony I could not think what to do. I will love you for always I will honor you with kisses and praise for the beautiful love of my life I will care for you in the kindest ways I know how I will wake up each morning to see you next to me and give thanks to all that is that you are by my side I will quietly smile each night in the thoughts of our love growing stronger as each day has passed I will laugh and play with you as often as the wind blows across the mountains I will look into your eyes like a child looks at a bright and sunny day. I will love you as my eternal love from this day on"

Please take a look at my portofolio in my profile. If you think I might fulfill your needs, then please feel free to give me a call. Since you have done a lot of trials already, I can give you a discount on my trial just so you'll consider me(Please, refer to wedding wire community when you call). I have experience with ethnics, and that was one of the main reasons besides my passion for makeup that i started as a MA in the first place.
I hope to hear from you. If you already find the perfect artist for you, then i wish you the best on one of the most important day of you life!  "
12063,27993,"Tell your dad.... Thats what my sister did when she found the perfect dress way out of her budget. Save it for your children to play with, daughter to wear at her prom. My husband made my dress from my moms 40 year old wedding dress, grandmothers fabric and some things he and my mom bought. Wedding dresses are beautiful in the closet and on the children as they grow. You could resell it but I wouldn't. Make it work. Call the desinger and see if she will give you wholesale prices for buying direct if you cannot afford it."
12059,27993,"Sounds great, Some beaches have coves or grass to protect you from the wind. There is a beautiful beach that is private and has picnic tables next to the Maui Prince Hotel on the South shore. The guests well love all the time they can get with you, they flew all this way for your wedding. You can make it a potluck style where you provide the basic supplies and the guests bring the main foods. Nobody expects you to pay for everything, nice thought but not always doable. I am here in Maui if you need anything.

11989,27993,"Dont assume she is covering the costs, just the coordinaton. Give her an envelope with the aproximate costs and a note that you would like to cover any extra costs and thank her for all her work. Give her a gift for her work as well. At this point she will probly give the money back to your parents and express this is her gift to you. Let it be at this time. 

If you simply do not have the money, let it go and enjoy your self, after all sounds like it was her offer.

We did not use lighters, our candles were lit and we cupped them as we walked slowly down the isle. At the alter my candle went out and my sister lit mine with hers. Sounds beautiful.

What she is doing is called playcating you by acting like a marter and you simply do not have to take that on or engage in her drama. She was probly taught this from her upbringing and it is the only way she knows how to act to get her way. A good friend would not allow her to treat you this way. You being the good friend would tell her your not having fun having her be your maid and she is welcome to come to the wedding if she wishes. I'd invite the sister in law and have some fun...

You might think you know who you want to invite but u might just want to make sure so there are no suprises. Once you know the # of guest for sure, then find a place, for the ceremony and reception. The florist and Invitations are also very inportant thing you should get done ASAP because depending on what you go by, you should send the invites 2-3 months in advance. I think 2 should be okay 4 u though since it's not a holiday. ALSO find your dress your bridesmaids dress ASAP!! You would be suprised but it could take three months to get the dresses to you and then you have alterations to do.

In the end everyone was happy especially us (which is all that matters)"
12103,56520,"I also have a lot of single guests invited. I am only accounting for the person I am inviting. However if I think they are the type of person to bring a date with them I put down 2 on the list. I mean not many single peope want to go to a wedding by themselves, whether they bring a date or a friend. I would just send the invite addressed to your co-worker and when you get the RSVP you will see who is and isn't bring a guest. You could put a small note in with the invite saying please limit your guests to 1 or you may bring 1 guest with you or something along those lines. "
12088,56520,"My mom is throwing the bridal shower, my maid of honor is throwing the bachelorette party. I think the maid of honor is supposed to be in charge of the parties for the bride and best man for the groom. I think that a 2 night beach party is something that is not really tradition and if your want that extra thing you should pay for it. Sorry if I sound rude but you really can't expect people to pay for that much especially when it is extra. I say bridal shower, bachelorette and bachelor parties are okay to ask for but anything other than that you should expect not to get anything at the wedding and I think its kind of inappropriate to ask for more."

My menu cards, cocktail napkins, favors , & matches all were the same theme black and white  Also the center pieces were tall candelabras with 3-4 dozen of white roses. It was very elegant.

Since my wedding theme was black and white and all the bridesmaids wore black gowns with a white sash  i didn't want her in black so we got her a white dress with a black sash and she wore white ballet slippers. "
11191,76862,"I had a maid of honor and A MATRON of honor (matron was married already)
But if i could re-do it I would have waited until I stated my planning and see who really was happy for me and was helping out. If that was the case both of them would had been bridesmaids.  Don't stress out about it   Whoever is more into the wedding I would choose"
11633,56520,"We also have a maximum that we cannot go over. What we did is account for everyone in each family, for example, if we invite Mr and Mrs. Jones we also account for their 3 children, just in  case and even though we know they might not come. This way we get an estimate but we know we definately won't go over. Only invite the people that have to be there and then you can add who you would like to be there. If you don't think they will come don't invite them. Also if you invite someone who is single and they are likely to bring a date with them, account for them bringing one guest. Hope this helps some."

Thanks for all the responses! Pink, fuschia and gold sounds great. And the black and white (sometimes with a pop accent color, sometimes without) seems to be very popular!

Or you could possibly have the dresses made.  You could also just stick with polka dot accessories and accents throughout the wedding instead of a polka dot printed dress.  I think it's a good idea and will give a very fun feel to your wedding, but you're going to have to look outside of the box for the items necessary to carry out the theme.  Good luck!"

My husband John and I, got civilly married last June, so that we could live together, and for immigration reasons. We are having a catholic ceremony on our anniversary, and the church in his hometown will be conducting our religious wedding. Then we will be renewing our vows in a Cathedral Basilica.

Don't worry, relax, and try to find a priest who's understanding. "
12090,18651,"Hi Tracy!

Make-up should run around $50-$150, depending on the service (ie. with what products used)and the package (some includes a ""trial"" day makeover, and also depending on how many in the bridal party.) My Atlanta make-up artist asks $150 for ""trial"" day and ""day-of"" service (whether regular or airbrush, plus lashes.) My Miami make-up artist is $175 for the bride+1 (may it be mother-of-the-birde or maide of honor) and $50 for each additional person after that. 

Always remember to put everything in writing. No verbal promises especially on important events. If a vendor promised something, remind them... speak out and demand it. 

Best wishes!"

I am inviting a friend from high school that wont know anyone other than my family at the wedding, shes not in a serious relationship but i think she should be allowed to bring a guest because she wont know anyone else really"
12254,32281,"As long as they're neutral (which I know you said they were) it's not a problem, you just don't want to have them clash with your color scheme.

If you decide you do want to include your color scheme on them somehow, you can always have the text printed in one of the colors from your scheme, and/or include jeweled accents or stickers or wax stamps to seal the envelopes.  These things can be found at a scrapbooking or craft store.

Plus you could always add the neutral color to your color scheme at the wedding and then your invitations are a part of the color scheme.

Hope this helps."
12253,54434,"$700 doesn't actually strike me as that unreasonable.  5 hours is a lot of party time.

But, since you can't afford it, I'd recommend going the Ipod route.  Load up the ipod with all the songs you want and designate somebody to man it.  You'll just need to get the sound equipment (rent or borrow).  Then you can have somebody tactful emcee the wedding.  

Another thought is check out craigslist and see if you can snag a decent dj who is trying to build his/her business.  Just make sure to hear them live first (demo tapes are bs, as they are often the product of post-production editing).

On the other hand, if you are willing to be $700 for 8 hours, why not for 5?  Do you really expect your party to go on that long?  I mean, the ceremony & cocktail hour don't need a dj.  

"
12254,34400,"An invitation that is neutral in color is fine.  It isn't necessary to let folks know what the color scheme of your wedding is.  What's more important is letting your guests know what the mode or type of attire will be for the wedding and you've covered that by stating that black tie is optional.

Having an invitation match your color scheme is one way to let your guests in on what to expect in terms of the look and feel of your wedding events.  For instance, an invitation that has light blues and greens with a picture of a seashell or starfish on it may signal to your guests that you are having your wedding on the beach.

Or, if the invitation is navy blue and white with some sort of nautical picture on it, that may indicate that the theme of the wedding has to do with the sea or may take place on a boat.  It doesn't necessarily mean that you would like them to dress in a specific color.

Hope this helps! :)"
12250,53299,"You can use Cherry Blossoms as your flower since the festival is held there every year. Maybe have the colors be Pink, white, and black. You ca find TONS of things that can tie into the whole cherry blossom theme. Good luck."
12253,32281,"You can always ask a friend or relative to be the DJ and/or Emcee at the wedding for you (and you could offer them doing this for you in place of a gift).  Make sure it's someone reliable and that they or someone else you know own a good quality stereo system.  Depending on where your reception is, you might be able to link into a speaker system that is already hooked up there.

The person you ask will also need to have a strong public speaking voice since they will be making some announcements such as introducing the bridal party.

I've also been to a wedding where the couple linked they're Ipod into the stereo system and then the bride's father was the Emcee for the night.  He memorized what song came before times where he would need to emcee, like the garter toss or the cake cutting, so that he could stop the Ipod after that song ended so he could make the announcement.  

Hope this helps."
12234,32281,"As silly as this sounds, have them flip a coin for it.  Get them both present at the same time (if possible) and explain that you love them both and you're torn about who you should dance with first so to be fair you're going to flip a coin.  Have them call it, and then no one has to feel like you played favorites."

12257,46106,"If it were me, I'd leave a message or send an email and just be honest.  Tell her that you miss seeing her, and that it's important that the two of you get together to talk about wedding stuff.  If you're serious about not wanting her in your wedding any longer, you could maybe ask her if she's still interested.  Tell her that you'd totally understand if her life has gotten hectic or she has other obligations that might make it difficult for her.  That will give her an easy out if she's over it, and maybe help remind her that it's something she should be acting on if she does still want to participate.

I personally think the bride and groom figurines are hideous, but I don't know that they'll ever disappear completely.  It does seem like most of what I've seen lately though is fancy frosting work, monograms, flowers, or something totally unique (like custom bobble-heads or rubber duckies).

Really though, I think the whole point is to do whatever makes you happy.  If the bride and groom make you smile, then go for it!"
12253,59907,"I have been a DJ for 33 years and have done hundreds of weddings.  I don't understand why you would need the dj service for 8 hours unless you are planning to have them play at the point of vows, at the cocktail hour and the reception.  My experience is that 5 hours is more than enough.  Take it from me even though it may seem like an easy job it isn't.  Packing all the equipment to bring, getting it to the place, setting up, playing the music, breaking it down after the party and unloading when you get back to the office is a job in itself.  Not to mention the cost of upgrading your equipment. I would suggest if you are having a smaller wedding (100 people or less) just go with 5 hours.  Your guests will still have a great time.  I hope this helps some.

The cake topper trend is definitely changing, but the traditional bride and groom will not go away fully. Bride and groom toppers with personality are the big thing this year.

12254,26876,"Its not bad, but the invitation does set the theme/mood for the wedding. I used my color scheme on my invites, which was black/white and reds. Its soley up to you, but it wouldn't be a bad idea if you do, like I said guests will have an idea what to expect at your wedding as far as mood and colors goes. "
12239,26876,"as far as the dresses go, maybe consider just getting and solid color and getting a polka dot sash, as mention before. You can find polka dot fabric at a fabric store, JoAnn fabrics. I think that would be easier, and from a bridesmaid point of view, probably more appreciated. Craft stores sell ribbon with polka dots that you can buy in bulk and be creative with. "
12220,69470,"Hi. I've actually been doing web design and marketing for the past 12 years and this is very easy to do. All you have to do is go to a domain registrar like GoDaddy.com and register the domain name that you want. GoDaddy.com cost $8.95 per year. Then you will utlize the 'forward domain' feature in My Domains to forward your domain name to the one that you want to use - mymemorypage.com/PeanutandGroom.

12253,44474,"Reducing the entertainment time is a good way to keep the cost down. But, there are other ways to cut back on services to reduce costs; e.g., I offer a discount to a couple that books within 2 weeks of when the quote is given.  If you find a DJ that you like, you can discuss the services and related prices to fit within your budget.  But, don't settle for a ""cheap"" DJ, based on only price.

Many couples, once the traditional wedding activities are completed, want to have some fun and party with their guests.  Planning a realistic schedule with the bride and groom for the reception and then making sure the activities are done in a timely manner is one way that the MC helps ensure that the evening is fun and meets the vision of the newly married couple.

12226,20427,"Thats a great idea. The only real problem you are going to encounter is that the Mother of the Bride is usually the last one seated before the wedding starts, so you will have to work around that. Not a big deal. The grooms Mother can be the last person seated."

Since I will be 16 days away from turning 21, I will need his parental consent.  He said he would consider it.  He didn't have any objections to the school part (which is what I was really worried about).  We listened to each other.  I'm just glad that he said he would at least consider it.

2) Go get an account on the Knot if you don't have one already and sign up to message with your local community....really great source of info on local vendors.

3) Make a list of what is important to you and rank it. Start working on the most important things  first (booking reception and ceremony venues to hold date, let friends & family know date etc.). Then work on the second set of things - i.e. flowers, invitations, food & cake, photos, video transportation, attire, jewelry, music etc.

4) Save the details for last....i.e. guestbooks, favors, etc. If you need these to make you happy, move them up on your to-do list. Favors were  the last things I did"

12274,52924,"Understandably so...this is a sticky situation.  Considering your loyalities lie with your MOH, is there a way you can have a heart to heart with her to get a feeling for how she will feel if the ex-SO is at the wedding. It may be that your MOH is the type who can put her drama aside for this one day.  Without knowing the history, it may be that the two of them can exist at the same event and politely avoid each other. Especially, since it sounds like they have joint friends and this will possibly happen again.

The other alternative is to call the ex-SO and nicely request for them to not attend considering the circumstances.  

Remember, this is your wedding day and it's most important that you and your fiance have a memorable experience. "
12267,52924,"Another thought is, when you are introduced, you can have the NFL theme song played and the dj/band can introduce you similarly to the way the game announcers list the stats for the opening players at the start of the game. For your table #'s you could have a friend or your photographer shoot you both tossing the football around. This is a fun twist on the idea of couples using their dog for the table # picture.  

Good luck with what you decide...I would love to hear about it."
12239,52924,"The polka dot theme is fun and bubbley.  When designing the table layout, you have to be careful for it to not look to busy.  You may want to seek hot pink and black polka dot items and accent with silver in other ways. For instance, if you are having chargers, consider silver ones or plates with silver trim around the edge. You may want your menu in to reflect the hot pink and black, but then have your napkin folded and tied with a silver ribbon.  

Without knowing what your centerpieces are, there is always a way to tie in silver to the centerpiece by using out of the box items.  Such as silver ribbon around the vase that holds the flowers or silver framse or easles for the table #'s.  

Feel free to email me at info@soireebliss.com for more brainstorming....the possibilities are endless."
12269,32281,"You need to have the dance floor and DJ because otherwise your guests aren't going to know what to do.  The reception will end up being a lot of sitting around talking and drinking and it will make for a very short reception (I went to a wedding that did this, it was a disaster).  

I do understand your fear though, I'm terrified of how my grandmother is going to react to my friends and new in-laws and all the dancing and drinking.  Just avoid songs that cause people to dance inappropriately, you know like ""Baby Got Back"", and other ones like that.

If you still really don't want dancing, you need to provide something else for your guests to do.  Karaoke is one way to include music at your reception, but avoid or atleast deter dancing."
12254,52913,"Since your invitations are a neutral color, you are fine! I like to tell my brides that their wedding is a reflection of them, not a ""wedding rule"". If you really like these invitations and they are within your budget, go for it and don't feel ashamed that they are not within a color scheme. All invitations are for is to notify your potential wedding guests of your impending nuptials. Guests are not concerned about the color of your invitations, much less the colors of your wedding. Put your dollar where it matters most to you!
Hope that this helps!

12274,58465,"you knew the girl for several months not years-  and it's ... ballsy of her to have assumed she was invited. In fact, most likely she is only coming to upset your MOH.
I'm surprised the mutual friends didn't intervene. 

Do she and the MOH even speak?  Can the MOH tell her she'd rather not see  her? If not then I  think you do need to explain that you would rather not have the potential for drama during the wedding. - good luck


"
12269,26876,"You know I've been to a couple receptions in which there was no dancing nor was there alcohol, and that was fine. There are many reasons as to why, including religious reasons. If your ok with just having music in the background thats fine, anything you and your FH decide should be fine. Be forwarned though it will get a little boring, as it was in the ones I went to. If you have a DJ and no dance floor it'll seem kinda pointless and almost a waste of money to have the DJ so if you have the DJ get a dancefloor, otherwise dont have any of them. The DJ will work with you to decide what selection of music you want. "
12269,36988,"I agree with Christina.  You can certainly work with your DJ to decide what type of music is played at the reception.  Maybe choose some ""oldies"" to which your guests can dance, but most likely will not include any offensive lyrics!

"
12275,26876,"Have you tried Grand Atrium in Vienna, VA. I had my reception there. They do everything onsite. I think they are reasonably priced, and you have a lot of control on the cost as far as the menu, the day you do it, how many guests, and also time. You pay a p/person price which includes the food, use of facility, staff, drinks. Prices range from $45-$90 p/person. The layout is awesome as well. Its like a two level place, you eat upstairs and you can look down to the dance floor. There is a piano, lots a places in which guests can sit and relax during the dancing. Its great!"
12267,26876,"You can have your officiant dress up as a referee(sp*), maybe your girls can wear a cheerleading type of outfit, and use pom poms instead of flowers, I think that can potentially save you money. As far a decor goes, Im not sure what to suggest. AS someone said before thas a challenge to make it classy. "
12239,26876,"You always expect to find everything that your looking for. I think your going to have to get creative and make somethings yourself. Like table cloths, if you buy them you can dye polka dots on them, but are you really going to buy table cloths for all of your tables? What will you do with them afterwards? You might have to consider using a plain table cloth and think of something else to give you the polka dot theme. And remember you don't want to overdo your theme, although its a nive theme, there's a point where it can stop looking cute and just a little to polka dot happy. "
12282,11213,"Is there a serial or reference number that you can compare? What about the manufacturer of the dress, can they help?  Or possibly is one last year's gown & one this year's gown? "
12256,11213,"My son & DIL used the initial of my son's last name.  It was a clear acrilic L that they added bling to.  We thought it would look tacky but it was really nice.  They had tons of compliments cuz it was so different."
11788,11213,"I was married at 18, had kids at 21 & am still married at 51.  My son was married on June 17th, found out she was pregnant on the 18th, then left for the honeymoon on the 19th. 9What a weekend, WOW) Their daughter is 14 mos now & I don't know what life would be like without her.  Everyone is different & you have to follow your heart & hopefully it will work out.  No one can predict the future so with what you think for the present.  Good luck!"

"
12257,11213,"I agree with the other.  Leave a message or email about going shopping.  Tell her that you are going shopping on a certain day & to let you know if she can go.  If you don't hear from her, assume she does not want to be in your wedding.  Maybe she's having personal or financial problems & it's hard for her to tell you.  But put her on the spot & specify a date & time for shopping.  Then the ball is in her court."
12269,67772,"My whle family & my FH's family is pretty liberal so I am not worried about the dancing...plus we both love to dance.  I couldn't imagine my wedding without dancing.  I want there to be a lot of upbeat pop & hip hop, as well as some romantic/r&b music.  So, I am getting a DJ & a dance floor.  During the cocktail hour though, I am gonna have the DJ just play light instrumental type music so people can chat, have some cocktails & hor douerves.  I say do what u think will fit you & your guests (or the majority of them) best."
12282,77473,"According to Copper Penny Bridal in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina near Charleston...I was told the picture I ordered from is indeed the GRACE gown (not to be mistaken with the maternity version) but that the product was poorly represented via color and the model's pose. I talked with the dress manufacturer in California who told me the picture I ordered from was taken down months ago because of the ""dark color"". I repeatedly asked her if this looked like the same dress I ended up getting. Like a broken record she would only say ""It is the same dress"". My wedding planner who also owns a boutique that sells dresses shared your same thoughts- maybe what I thought I was ordering was an ""original"" version of the Grace Gown... which was later changed to meet a demand for another style."
11757,996,"I don't know anything about that resort, but we took a vacation to Aruba and it was pretty nice.  My wife liked Hawaii better, but the Aruba beaches are pretty and there's good nightlife and lots to do.  The only thing I didn't like is that it was SUPER windy there.  "
12275,55618,"They are booked for a CHRISTMAS PARTY!! ARRGHHH!

I think that was one of the first couple of places that I called. It looks like a beautiful venue.  I'm sure you had a great reception though :o)
Thank you for your response.  I was starting to feel like posting wasn't going to be much help.  You revived my HOPE!"
12253,18651,"Congratulations on your engagement!

$700 for the first 5Hours is actually good. Five hours should be adequate enough time cost effective wise) for entertainment. You can also opt for the iPod (hook it up and play)on music and hire a family/friend to be the emcee (as a gift.) Another alternative is a live band. For an event I did in North Miami Beach, Florida, a Live Band played for $400 for 5 Hours. They were great if you like blues, jazz and funk music.

12256,77548,"To answer your second question first, yes the traditional bride and groom figurines is not the latest fashion.  

As for the wedding cakes I make at Nana Pearl's, very few couples have traditional toppers. Lately, many couples don't even want flowers on top.  Monograms are popular, as are objects that have a sentimental value to the couple.  You can check the website for some intresting links: http://www.nanapearls.com/news.html

That being said, if you want a traditional figurines for your wedding cake, have them.  It is your wedding, you can have figurines if you want to.  Just consider the overall tone/theme you want for your wedding day: whimsical, retro, sophisticated, romantic, dramatic...?  Or, do you want to be a princess for a day?

Happy planning,

12239,45992,"Hi Adorable,

Have you tried the Los Angeles Garmet District. Located between 9th and Los Angeles street in downtown LA. You can find resonably priced dresses and a wide variety of selections. It's always best to go with your bridesmaids on a Saturday Morning and make a day of it then have lunch at a Mexican Restaruant on Alvera Street (provided you like Mexican food) there is also china town for eating. 

Good luck!

12274,45992,"Hi Nikki,

It is deffinately your wedding day. A Maid of Honor is a very special person to the bride. She is someone whom you trust and should be a very responsalbe person. Meaning she should have some duties to go along with her title. She should be honored to be that special person in your wedding, and take her job seriously; provieded you give her some repsonsabilities. She should be there for you not for the other person or herself. Just some food for thought...hope this helps you."
12267,45992,"Hi Soonerqt,

Wow you are going to make a very special wife. Giving him what he wants is important. I say be as creative as you can at the reception. and let the rest of the wedding be traditional. Well if you have a DJ perhaps he/she can help you with some ideas. Heres one Idea at the end of the reception you could change into a cheerleader outfit and with your brides mades do a little cheer performance for him.

Good Luck!

12269,46106,"I agree with almostmrs.johnson that you should do what fits you and your guests the best.  My fiancé and I don't like to dance, nor do the vast majority of our guests.  Our wedding is going to be very small, and full of people who don't get to see each other very often.  An enormous meal and several hours of drinking wine, talking and enjoying each other's company is really the perfect thing for us and our guests.  We're having a classical string duo there to play during the ceremony and reception."
12267,53299,"As your favors you could have football shaped cookies. Maybe instead of the ""traditional"" wedding food, you could serve an upscale version of what is served at either a tailgate or at the stadium.

12239,20483,"in regards to the bridesmaids dresses...polka dots can be added by using a sash or accent on the dress....however if you do want a dress completley covered in polka dots having it custom made is your best bet unless you are able to find them in a retail store based on the sizes and qty needed.... a polka dot ribbon can be added to embellish your invitations or party favors as well... ;)

12306,53299,"I am having my reception there! I think maybe you should do sort of like a ""Secret Garden"" thing. Are you getting married in the courtyard that they have? If you are that would be kinda cool since you have all of the ivy surrounding you and you can incorporate that theme with tons of florals, and not just flowers, greenery too.

We are doing a ""Starry Night"" theme, with Navy and Silver as our colors.

12308,26876,"I believe in the saying ""Killing 2 brids with one stone"" I think that should be ok, and as long as you make her feel special and everyone is ok with it, even if they're not invited to the wedding, that is all that matters. Just plan it the same way you would a shower, let that be the focus, more than the your leaving us part. "
12274,39625,"Omg! I'm so sorry for you Nikki!
To be honest with you, you could always ask your MOH what she thinks you should do after letting her know that the ex-SO, decided to invite herself.
Maybe she could even talk to the ex-SO when realizes what kind of a position you've been put in.
Good Luck! (I'm crossing my fingers for you)"
11534,64981,"I think religious venues are wonderful and can be absolutely gorgeous. 

I also feel that you can have a lovely, spiritual and reverent ceremony in a beautiful private setting as well. Perhaps your minister would be willing to travel to the venue to have the best of both worlds.

I do believe that working with a private venue will allow you more flexibility with the ceremony decor and ceremony program details than a church would. This is a big factor that should also help in allowing you to make the best decision."
135,45138,"I bought the book and found it to be useful as a starting point for myself not ever planning a wedding before. But, I couldn't plan the wedding myself, even though we are having under 100 people. There are just too many specific situations tht this book does not cover. 

After a few months into the planning process and having this book and others, I still had to get the guidance of a seasoned professional to handle the small details you wouldhave never though about. Get the book so you can feel you know what to expect, but don't fire your weding planner. 
This book DID teach me how to negotiate better and network. i have so many people helping nd it is saving a ton and they are all glad to be a part of the wedding. "
11691,64981,"Hi There:)

Your budget is definately going to determine what you select to not only include in the box or bag, but the box or bag themselves. Those can be inexpensive to quite elaborate as well.

The Basics

An Itinerary of the events of the wedding and any other wedding weekend events, locations, start times, places to board buses, etc.

A map of things to do. There are some fun maps of the Las Vegas strip if you are a Las Vegas couple. Also check out www.visitlasvegas.com!

a couple of bottles of waters (you can customize your own lables quite inexpensively).

One nice local item that is memorable. If it is a food item, then something not perishable is best.

If the local item is other than food then maybe a little snack (again, try for something local-Vegas has great potato chops, Ethel M. Chocolates casino chips for example).

And finally, a welcome and thank you note from the two of you. Print it out on nice card stock in a pretty font & hand sign it."
11996,64494,"If you use the yellow pages be sure to ask for references. Also go to small bridal boutiques and ask the sales reps who they would recommend. Any good seamstress will gladly give you references."
11720,64494,"9 is not to old to be a flower girl. y flower girls are my fiance's nieces in 7th and 8th grade. I do not want children in the wedding so their dresses are slightly different and yes they are the flower girls."
12287,38515,"I agree with the first answer. What I'm gonna be in the same situation so I'm gonna do something I read about in one of the bridal magazines. It suggested getting everyone something different, something each person would like, so that it's more personal. And my MOH will be getting something more special because she's my MOH. I would hope no one would be offended and just appreciate their gift. Good Luck!"
12308,38515,"I agree, but I would also ask your sister. She might think that is a good idea, or she might feel like it puts her in an wierd position for maybe having to explain to people why they aren't invited. You would think people would understand, but some people don't. Good Luck!"
12324,20427,"Beautiful choice! You could do a different favor for each layer. Chocolate, red velvet, lemon, etc. "
12256,56581,"I've never been a big fan of the traditional bride and groom cake toppers and I am trying to personalize a lot, so we are using one of our framed engagement photos as a cake topper. Picture frames will be on every other tier of the 4-tiered cake and on the table, and in other decorations, to tie it all together."
12282,11063,"I hate to say it, but by looking at the picture that you ordered from, I can see a cumberband.  It is difficult to see because of the color, but I noticed it.  The model's pose is strange, and could conceivably hide a skirt that is fuller than it looks, but it does not look as a-line as the dresses that you received.  Also, the material appears to be different to me, but it's difficult to tell from pictures.  Sorry to hear about all of your stress over the dresses!  It's the last thing you need so close to your wedding."
12306,56581,"I don't think you necessarily need a specific theme, but when I hear your colors calla lilies come to mind. A ""theme"" can be as simple as the color palette you are already planning on using, all the way to all out everything-under-the-sun-involving-your-theme is at your wedding, it all depends on what you want to do..."
12324,56581,"First things to consider is what kind of cake you and your FI like/what is special to you and what your bakery offers. For example, my best friend loves chocolate, so they had a chocolate/chocolate cake. My fiance and I met at a party over carrot cake, so we are serving carrot cake. Your bakery should let you do a tasting where you can sample different combinations of cake and filling flavors. If you still aren't sure, ask the bakery what are their most population combinations and/or the baker's favorite."
12274,27993,"Your MOH is one of your closest friends and this other person would only be manipulative is she insisted on attending, likly your concern for hurting her feelings should over ride with her concern for making your special day uncomfortable for your MOH. If she has no feeling about upseting your MOH than I would not be concerned with how she takes it when you tell her it will not work out for her to attend you wedding day. Offer to compenstate her for the hotel room and plane ticket if you have the money other wise let it go. Your MOH did... for some apparent reasons from your posting. Have the wedding of your dreams which includes your MOH being honored as the one who would stand up for you, stand up for her too.,...

"
12267,27993,"Thats so cute. Let him plan it and then see if you can invite some of his favorite players and have the DJ annouce them like an annoucer would. Think about the honored guests at the games and set up your tables similar.. Have your cake shaped like a football and decorated the way you wish. "
12308,50366,"I have been in work environment situations where we have thrown showers for a co-worker knowing full well that we were not going to be invited because of limitations of the guest list.  It was still a lot of fun and we did it because we wanted to wish that person well.  Most people understand about tight budgets and keeping it small.  I would say the people that you are inviting have already expressed an interest in doing ""something"" for your sister and are close enough to your sister that they realize that they cannot be invited because of the size of the wedding. I think it is lovely that you will be giving her a shower and I say go for it.  "
12253,50366,"As a DJ myself, I have to agree with a few of the other posters.  That $700 is a very reasonable price for 5 hours.  A five hour wedding reception is plenty of time to have a great wedding reception.  

I would truly try to bite the bullet on this one and NOT go the iPod route.  When playing music you want it to ""flow"" and you also have to know who is on the dance floor at the time the music is being played.  

Let's say people are finally having a great time on the dance floor to some fast paced music and .... SCREECH! a slow song comes on... that can break the mood instantly, and they will be less likely get back up on the dance floor!  Not to mention a professional DJ/emcee is invaluable when it comes to keeping the flow of the wedding going.  

The only alternative that I see is to hire your DJ to set-up before the coctail hour pay her an early set-up fee and play your iPod for cocktails and dinner - than have him/her play for the dancing.  That may bring your cost down.   "
11549,74609,"Are you getting married right in front of the venue? They should be able to help with the chairs and what sorts of decorations can be cleaned up easily. 

It would be really nice from a photography stand-point if your ceremony was right on the waters edge so any passersby would walk behind the guests and not behind the ceremony.

Check out what time sunset is and leave time for photos in that magic hour right before sunset. You will really be glad that you slipped away for some sunset on the beach photos when you get your album! :)

Have fun planning your wedding! You are going to have a blast!"
12324,53299,"We just had the tasting for our cake. We are also haveing a 4-teir cake. I was told that you want to stick to two flavors because you do not want one to run out and people to start asking for it. We have picked out what we want and what we think people will like. For the top and bottom layers of the cake we are having a white cake (not the vanilla yellow, its white, made with egg whites) with passion fruit purree and blackberry italian meringue buttercream. For the middle two layers of the cake we are having a bananna cake (kinda like bananna bread w/o the nuts) with a chocolate italian meringue buttercream.

I would stay away from anything with nuts just in case of a nut alergy. And just go with stuff that you like, not what you think a wedding cake is supposed to be. Good luck!"
12274,69027,"I agree with some of the ladies here. I definitely think that you should have a nice talk with your MOH. Reason I say this is because, this is more of her problem and not yours. Its her ex and she should deal with that issue. If she pefers her not to be there, then that is her problem. I hate to be a bit of a meany about the situation, but you as a bride have more things to worry about as your date gets closer and closer. Plus she should step in and say hey, we broke up I really don't see a reason for you to be at my friends wedding. Don't stress yourself over that. That should be taken care of by your MOH. She shouldn't have you do that."
12327,39625,"You could always string around the top and the bottom of the vase, a glue gun will be handy. Or if the vases are clear glass, you could always put the pearls in the vase.
Good Luck!"
12330,56520,"That is really pretty. How did you do that? Its so perfect!!"
12330,39625,"It's very pretty!"
12239,56520,"The woman who is making my wedding cake has made a cake with your colors and it is really pretty, go to www.sweetwaterbakehouse.com and look through her gallery. You might want to use that as an idea. You could have solid color table linens with a runner in the middle that is polka dot. I would say have the bridesmaids wear pink with a white sash or vice versa. Maybe black an pink. I think if you just have accents of polka dot that would be pretty and then use the colors of the polka dots as your solids. Good luck. Make sure you check out that site because that cake would be perfect for you."
12330,77752,"wonderful!  how did you make it?  i would love to do something like that for my wedding!!"
12282,70212,"Hi Angie! 

This is a very stressful time for you, your wedding is in a week and two days. Just relax, the dresses will look fine. Yes, they are not what you expected, but you might as well learn now, so you can enjoy your wedding, just roll with the punches.

I learned this because I was married once already. A week before my wedding I freaked out and though oh my God I chose the wrong wedding gown (it came in looking how I pictured it, I just got scared I made the wrong choice), and I ran to another store and tried on a different gown, as if there was time to order it! lol

By the time the wedding day arrived, I decided to let go of control. If anything went wrong, or anyone asked me any questions, I told them to ask the maitre d'. I was all about letting go and having fun now. Just do it, and you'll enjoy the day.

Hope this helps.

12239,55279,"HI,It can be done. If you are in the Baltimore areas, there is a vendor called Gala Cloths- she is located in Reisterstown.  Contact me directly and I will give you her information if you can not locate it. I saw a table she did with black and white polka dots. Then you can add pink accessories. I believe she has this in her supply as she had to make it special for another bride. I hope this helps. Let me know.

12274,70212,"Hi Nikki,

No way. Tell her she's not invited. I mean, of course, do it in a nice way. But that's ridiculous. She's obviously trying to manipulate you into feeling obligated to be polite and let her come. 

Send her an email and cc it the email to the group of friends that ARE invited (so there's proof) and say something like:

Hi So and So,

I was surprised to receive your email RSVPing to my wedding, as I have not yet sent out the invitations. I'm so sorry about your break up with [MOH], I know it must be difficult for you. But as you are no longer on [MOH]'s invitation as a guest, this is a very awkward situation. 

I wish you all the best,

12274,70212,"P.S. About the hotel room and plane tickets,...I tried to get out of a business deal with a new ""friend"" who I got a bad feeling about. She told me she just put $140 into the business for something (without informing me first) and I felt so bad I stayed in the business with her and it was hell. She was even worse than I thought.

So I think the plane ticket and hotel $$ mention is also to put pressure on you. Don't even fuss about that. She chose to do it without informing you or waiting to see if she was invited. (Probably in order to get invited.)"
12267,70212,"Hi, I love it! 

Yes, cake like a football. And then use the colors of his favorite team. I like the getting some football players there idea. His tie and cumberbund can also be those football colors. Table centerpieces can be a different football logo for each table. Groomsmen can wear rented football uniforms instead of a tux. Bridesmaids can have flirty dresses like cheerleaders and carry pom poms instead of bouquets. (Maybe have hair in pig tails)

have fun! let us know what you do!
Breidie"
12239,70212,"Hi did you find your gown?

I saw a beautiful wedding gown with polka dots."
12331,78176,"It can be a hassle. The first thing you need to do is go to your local Social Security office. Bring a name change form (you can print it online from their website), marriage certificate, birth certificate, a photo ID, and bring current social security card just in case. Don't mail the application, it can take a very long time to get it resolved, and they often misplace the applications. Bringing it in person usually get results in two weeks.
When you get your new card in the mail you have to go to your local RMV and change your ID. Bring your new card, your marriage certificate, and your license/state ID. 
You will also need to go to the bank, call your credit card companies, your utility providers, your payroll department, and so on and change your name. 
The first time you file your taxes after changing your name can be a little confusing and may cause a temporary delay, but afterwards it should be fine.
"
12146,50853,"A beautiful hand-tied bouquet could include red roses (check out the more unique Red Intuition roses which are red on red)with red mini calla lilies with white stephanotis that have black pins in their center.  You can have the stems wrapped in white satin ribbon with a second thinner black ribbon ""striped"" over it.  If you wanted to add another flower you could use red ranunculus which are now available all year. "
12327,50853,"Strands of your pearls could be artfully placed around the base of the vase (they'd look nice on a mirror with votive candles interspersed; layered inside the bottom of the vase and then insert the flowers; carefully placed among the flowers and secured in place with flower glue; or you could even wrap the strands around the complete outside of some of the vases and just around the base of others and even ""stripe"" about three rows together around others - mix it up.  "
11916,70212,"Wer Wer,

These gothic gowns are gorgeous! A little frustrating because only some of the pictures will enlarge.

Breidie"
12221,50853,"Peonies are definitely available in June.  It should not be a problem to obtain them."
11663,55279,"Hi, 
Another idea is to construct a small hardwood floor area just for the stage. This may be very cheaply done if you use laminate flooring. "
12332,78176,"First you need to decide exactly how much you have available and are willing to spend on your wedding. Once you have that established you have to determine what you will be spending on each aspect of the wedding from the budget you have set. That gives you a basis of what's reasonable and whats out your budget. 
Some suggestions to keep the cost down:
*Make your own favors.
*Make your own center pieces
*Get close friends and family together to cook and have a buffet style dinner.
*Research wholesale and bargain sites to find bargains on wedding apparel.
*You can also make your own invitations.
*If you have your ceremony at a local rental hall (like a VFW) you can have the reception there as well and not pay any more money.

Just remember just because you make them yourself doesn't mean it won't be beautiful. Just have fun and stick with your budget and your should be fine."
12201,50853,"I also think that white should be your main flower color with just one other accent color that would make the ""tropic"" color pop.  If this is the ""pool blue"" color, I've used orange with this which looked great, but a hot pink would also work well, particularly if you wanted black accents as well. A useful tip would be to go to a paint store and pick up a black, a white, and a ""tropic"" color card and play with the other available colors until you find a group of colors that pleases you. Good luck!"
12324,26876,"Since your wedding is in the summer, have you considered a fruit filling? something with strawberry, peach, pinneapple would taste sooo yummy. I think its much better than your regular frosting filling. That kind of filling tastes great with yellow cake, as long as its moist it'll be soo good, trust me. "
12331,26876,"Your will have to sign your certificate with your maiden name anyway, because your not legally his wife yet. So if you wait it wont be any more work than doing it right away. The first thing to do is go to the social security office, with the letter they give you stating your new married name, you can do anything. So the first thing to do is social security office, and then go to your DMV/MVA whatever you call it where you live, have your license changed. Once you have that done, you can slowly do everything else. You don't have to get everything done in one day. To honest with you I've been married 9months and still have changed my name on 2 my credit cards, but it doesnt afffect you, your still the same person, just different last name. The only thing is that if they ask for your ID with your credit card then it can a small prob, but who really checks them nowadays anyway? They should though. Good luck, let me know if you have any other question."
12332,26876,"Also, don't forget that how many guests you decide to have will determine how much you can spend too. I had my wedding for under $10K. I had 2 years to plan it and I did a lot of stuff myself. Let me tell you that Craft stores will be your new best friend. I made my own invites, it only cost me about $50 bucks versus $130+ for something similar I saw. I made my own centerpieces, and arrangements at my ceremony. I made the favors, except for the wine bottles i had to order those. Anything stationary I made. The cake topper, the arch, plus somet other things I can't think of right now. I mean there is a lot you can do yourself, you just need to be willing to do it. And there will have to be some compromising, dont forget."
11642,50853,"Transforming a space is a lot of work and you'll have enough to do right before your wedding.  Plus it could end up costing you a lot of money which would end up blowing your budget anyway.  I would aim for a unique space that requires minimal decorating and works into your budget.  It would save you time, stress, and money in the long run.  I don't know the size of your wedding but unique spaces where I've worked - that are not the large mansions which can be costly - are mostly in the Philadelphia suburbs but would include:  Columbia Station (an old train station); Bolingbroke (small, but an historical home and you choose the caterer); Baldwin School (Frank Furness architecture); Morris Arboretum; Pearl Buck Estate: Welkenweir (historical estate now a nature preserve; Mercer Museum; Fonthill Castle; Occasions in New Hope; Moshulu; and Villanova Conference Center (ballroom attached to a mansion).  Feel free to email me through my website if you have any questions. "
12245,50853,"What a fun idea!  Are you serving Italian food?  You definitely should have cannolis as least.  I'd use black, white, red, and silver for colors. Centerpiece containers could have little black bow ties on them. Have your florist use rhinestones, lights, and bling on your bouquets and in your centerpieces.  Have an opera singer during cocktail hour.  You could have Godfather trivia cards on the tables then, too.  Your wedding could be ""black tie optional"".  Have a ""gangster"" (or Marlon Brando look alike) make an appearance.  At your rehearsal dinner, many brides are having a grooms cake.  You could have one in the shape of a horse's head.  Some bride's hire cigar rollers for the men - which would be appropriate here. Black vintage car for the bride and groom to travel in.  The bride could carry a silk bag for envelopes. For table numbers you could do vellum numbers (or sayings) over scenes from the movie.  Email me through my website if you want to talk about more. "
12330,58465,"looks great!  Some DIY, looks,,, like they did it themselves!  BUt you did a great job congrats!"
2170,45992,"Hi Matt & Lyanne,

12282,77473,"Thanks to everyone for their insight and encouragement on this forum. Despite, this mishap I can't help but be so excited about the wedding!"
12331,46106,"It's going to be a hassle either way, so the timing probably doesn't matter much.  Good luck!"
12324,54434,"The first thing to do is find out what flavors of cake and filling your baker offers.  Then set up a tasting of the cake & filling combos you both think will be interesting.  Chocolate will always go over well.  Instead of vanilla, you could try white chocolate cake, lemon, orange, etc.  Some bakers will treat the cake to a brushing or soak in a flavored liquor if you are into that.  Think chambord or grand marnier.  Fruit fillings can be jams, crushed fresh fruit, or baker fillings mixed into a mousse or buttercream.  Take home the leftovers from the tasting for family to dig into.

I'd caution against super unusual flavors (like Black Forest Cake).  If you are really attached to something like that, make it a groom's cake or the small tier.

Our cake is going to be 2 layers of lemon cake with homemade blueberry jam filling and 2 layers of dark chocolate fudge cake with homemade raspberry filling."
12332,35713,"Budgeting is easy, once you know what is most important to you. 
1. Discuss your budget & come up with a number. 
2. Write a list of ""Must Haves"" & ""Wants"" & ""Optional"". Three columns to figure out what is most important to you & your fiance. 
3. There are so many alternatives to doing a wedding inexpensively. There are websites online that you can order bulk flowers from and do your own bouquets and centerpieces. It's actually rather easy & with just a little help from your family you can have fresh flowers on your wedding day without having to worry about price. 
4. Doing your own invitations & stationary is very inexpensive nowadays. There are alot of online resources to help you get ideas and alternatives. Go to a local Michael's and you'll realize how much you can do on your own. 
5. Instead of doing a wedding cake...why not do a tower of pastries put on each table. Less expensive and different. 
6. IF you want more advice on cost saving ideas to do your wedding, just email me! "
12327,35713,"You can also de-strand the pearls and glue the pearls around the vase so the vase looks like it's made of pearls. Maybe you don't even need to have the strands, or anything for that matter, on the table. Placing votives around your centerpiece may be enough decor. PLus it will illuminate beautifully off the pearls and flowers. Personally I always recommend leaving the extra stuff off the tables to create a more clean and elegant table. "
12324,35713,"One of my clients did a lemon poppy cake with coconut creme filling inside. I have to say it was the best cake I've ever tasted from ANY wedding I've done. It has a smooth finish on the palette. It's unique enough that people will say wow that was different. A little tangy and not overly sweet, and when you cut it, it has a nice clean elegant look. "
11984,52593,"I would let her pick something just so she'll enjoy it more. She might pick some Ashlee Simpson or or Avril Lavigne song, but it will make it more memorable for her without affecting the meaning for you and your new husband.

I had a couple who use Bad Day by Daniel Powter. Admittedly it is not a proper song for a wedding, but when I asked the bride why they would play that some on their wedding day she told me it was her new stepson's favorite song. There was not a dry eye in the house, including me.

Here's the video to prove it:

"
12354,35713,"Formal: Suits, Tuxes, long dresses & closer to a fancy night out. Semi-formal: Maybe a suit, but jacket with a button down shirt, khakis, summer dresses & not evening dresses, but cocktail dresses. I think if you want to not demand people dressing in a more evening style put down semi-formal on the invitation. This will let people feel comfortable to dress in a nice pair of slacks or a suit and not feel under or over dressed. Same thing goes for women. Some women might like wearing a nice evening dress to a wedding & some don't. This gives them the option to dress up or down as much as they feel comfortable, without compromising the style & elegance of your guests. "
12257,35713,"I had a similar experience with my wedding. I had a bridesmaid who didn't come to the shower, bachelorette party or rehearsal dinner. She was MIA, or always too busy to do any of the activities. Ultimately, she got a dress, and was in the wedding party, (and she left the wedding early..keep in mind we never even had a falling out...she just wasn't interested). IF I had to do it again, I would have just asked her flat out what he issue was. Was she still interested in being a part of the wedding & tell her that you feel a little hurt that she's showing no interest in your special day. This day IS about you! And it should be. I recommend calling her out on it (tactfully..and delicately...IF you don't want to hurt her feelings). OR you have the option of saying ""Honestly (insert bridesmaid name here), I feel like you've shown no interest and I don't know if I want someone who's not interested standing there next to me on my special day. Now, I hate looking at her in the pictures! "

12353,69113,"Hi Keesta,
Typically the Save the Date includes your names, the location and date foremost.  If most of your guests are traveling from out of town you can include the lodging information as well.  Remember though, this is also an area to have a little bit of fun and express your personality. You are right, all of the  actual information should be included with the invitation so don't worry to much about the business side here, maybe a brief mention of a block of reserved rooms should do the job.

Nicole"
12353,26876,"I don't think you even have to include all of that on the save the date. The purpose of it is just that, save the date. If you have a website put that info on there not the magnet. Include the website on your magnet. So basically all you really need to include are your names of course, and the date, as well as something like ""inviation to follow"" and if you have a website with all the info you want your guest to know then add the site somewhere.

For Christmas she gave me a gorgeous blue topaz necklace (her color was ""pool""- it was an exact match!) and told me it was also my MOH gift.  It was so beautiful and it made me feel really special.  During the rehearsal dinner she gave out gift bags to each of us that all had the same stuff in them.  I don't think anyone else knew about the necklace.  It worked out great!  I think giving your MOH a Tiffany bracelet is a great idea and is a wonderful way to honor your special relationship with her."

If your mind is already set on a destination wedding, please ignore this posting. Having recently attended a wedding abroad as a guest, I found that it's incredibly expensive.  One must book flights, hotel, local transportation, passports, etc. and with the weak dollar everything outside the US costs more.  I don't know what your budget is, but you might consider having the wedding reception in your home town and then planning a honeymoon abroad.

I'm going for the red or purple because I don't want to be completely opposite and do black although thats my heart of hearts I love black it looks good on almost everyone and it's slimming!!! "
12401,26876,"I'd suggest you contact weddingwire to see if they even allow it...they would know best anyway."
12403,26876,"Im trying to picture what your talking about, and if you mean the taper candles, I think it might look too plain. I think it would look better with the thicker round candles with something else other than a mirror, which is commonly used. The taper candles will also burn faster and you also want to make sure they are very secured. I went to a party which used the taper candles, the one at our table fell over and luckily it fell on a plate otherwise any cloth would have caught fire. "
12330,26876,"It looks great! Might I suggest maybe starching it. My cousin did her own runner too, Im not sure she used muslin as her fabric, but she starched it and it really kept its place while the people walked over it and it harder to wrinkle. Not sure if it'll help but thought I'd throw that out there. "
12236,34022,"I am not familiar with them personally...however, a bit of advice in selecting a photographer: I checked out their website - their gallery for weddings is minimal. Ask them to see the photos from an entire wedding. All the photos. I only saw 10 wedding photos on their website when I clicked on wedding. That isn't enough to make a decision to hire someone. As a photographer, I show my potential clients not only my gallery that is online, but will also show the photos (all the photos) from a wedding so they can see my ""showcase"" photos in my online gallery, but also see an example of what brides receive. Part of your decision is that you must LOVE his/her work. If you dont love the pictures, nothing else matters. Also, you will be with your photographer a lot that day. ask yourself: Would my fiancé and I be friends with this photographer even if we werent getting married? If the answer is yes, then you are that much closer to hiring the right wedding photographer for you.

12393,69519,"Hi Soon-to-be Mrs. Edmonds,

I attented running of the brides at Filene's Basement in Union Square.
I was skeptical about finding the style dress that I had in mind (Mermaid) & yes I found it & I absolutely loved it!!! Pointers...
Bring as many of your friends as possible this way they can help you grab as many gowns as possible. Try to be there as early. If you get there late & the rack are empty DO NOT DESPAIR wait about an hour & you'll start to see the gowns back on the racks. Remember each soon to be bride is grabbing as many as she can but will eventually purchase one & place the others back. Remember if you have a few gowns that don't fit or are not to your liking don't place them back on the racks until you try & trade with someone else who may have one that didn't fit them or was not the style they had in mind. Good luck, have fun & enjoy the experience. I surely did. xoxo  "

12403,73454,"candles are classy and can really set the mood in the room.  I think they're a great alternative instead of flowers.  We are having branches with votive candles instead of flowers.  Flowers look great when you enter the room but then they don't matter.  They are also expensive and at the end of the night, if people don't take them, they get thrown away."

I believe that's dress you wanted, and you don't need to bid on it you can buy it immediately from the seller. It's also in your size, has never been worn and is half the price of one from store.
You only have a day to purchase it though :S
Hope this helped.

12430,14163,"Just a thought....Have you checked EBay? I just looked and found a size 10 Marisa #754 for $1695.00 and it is New.

There are also other gowns by Marisa on the site. 

Some vendors on EBay are actual stores that have found another avenue forselling their merchandise.

I did a blanket search for 'Marisa 754' on AOL...try Google and Yahoo too.

Good Luck!"

We have had brides in the past give giftbags...in the bags they put matching flip-flops for later in the day after the shose come off, gum, breath mints, asprin, and stain remover sticks, snack bars...what ever you can come up with this is a way to help them through the day. For the guys she put chapstick, handywipes for sweaty faces...All in all its really the thought that counts.

12257,45992,"Hi FutureMrsRule,

That is so unfortunate, If you really want to ask someone else, send her an email and a voice mail and a letter asking her to respond by a certain date, and if she does not reply let her know you will have to ask someone else...she might have some personal problems that is effecting her and she is not able to attend...Do you have any personal aquaintences with her like a family member you know, that might be able to get in contact with her for you. Its best that you try at least to make personal contact with her and ask her how she is doing, she might be going through a difficult time right now.


Best of Luck!

12385,28642,"My FH & I are getting married 4/19/08 in St. Thomas, USVI.  Picked it for relatively cheap flights ($380 rt), no need for a passport, and we both had always wanted to get married on the beach.  Plus, my FH & I live about 1 1/2 hours from my hometown, so going the ""traditional"" route...eh...didn't want to deal w/it.  My parents are throwing us a casual reception in my hometown at the end of June.  I searched online & found a wedding planner who had numerous packages to pick from - I just gave her our ideas & she planned it all out.  In all (ceremony, flights, hotel, spending cash) it will cost us < $10,000.  We invited immediate family & a few close friends - 16 guests total.  We also made sure to send out the invitations at least 6 months ahead so if they wanted to go, they had time to set some money aside.  We had a few turn it down, but most accepted.  They all are looking at it like our wedding is a substitute for their annual vacation...nobody expected us to pay for anything."
12430,78724,"Thank you so much ladies for your responce. I contacted the seller on ebay and he/she would not budge on the price. Unfortunately the current price is a over my budget (although still a good price compared to the bridal shops), especially since I already purchased a dress and need to sell it. But that is the dress, oh so pretty! 

I really appreciate your help and for taking the time to do the search.

12327,21407,"You can drape the strands of pearls through your flowers and drape them over the side of the vases and let it puddle on the table, or just put them partly in the vase, then over the edge and fall down onto the table. We have done this with several centrepieces, and placed strategically, they look great. You can only put them through the flowers though, as long as they aren't too big, or heavy. "
12460,26876,"I guess you can ask for any packages they may offer, is there a minimum of hours you have to rent the limo, obviously their rates and about their fleet. What do they recommend for x number of people to ride. "
12461,26876,"Are you refering to walk down to, or to play in the background while guests wait? What kind of music are you interested in, classical, Jazzy etc? I mean there is so much tha can be suggested, but if you give us a little more details we might be able to help you narrow down some of your choices.

Even though his is not the most desirable last name (I'll change from a Klein to a Stubbs), I love him dearly for who he is, good and bad, funny last name or not.  I guess, to me, that's what starts off a new chapter in your life.  Just my $.02...  "

12470,26876,"I had a july wedding too, although I didn't do unity candles I had thought about it. What I was recommended is to not light the taper candles till whenever it was time for them. I had thought maybe having a votive candle lit inside a tiny hurricane have that hidden behind the center candle, then when it was time to light the unity candle you didn't have to worry about using a lighter or matches and having it look tacky. Im not sure if it would have worked, but it was an idea. "
12403,27993,"Candles are elegant!!!  I would suggest the thicker ones for less maintance. Do what is in your budget and do not even think about if your guests would think you are cheap. Anyone who would even think that is in their own judgement  process and you do not need to take on their unnessary trips. Not everyone in love and wanting to share their love with their friends and family has large amounts of money for their wedding day. (although it would be fun) The creativity and love going into preparing for your day are truely treasured moments, not worth worring over judgmental guests.  Have fun, sounds elegant and beautiful."
12385,27993,"My husband and I live in Maui and went to Orcus Island in Washington State for our destination wedding. I loved it, the whole weekend was focused on sharing time with friends and family and our love. Cost can be an issue with some guests, we had 100 guests, most flew in and came for the weekend. If cost for guests is an issue be sure announce their presence is their present to you."
11987,38149,"Don't miss the Cheese Shop in Merchant's Square - perfect lunch spot, and a favorite.

I've heard that the Chef's Kitchen is a really neat experience (though I haven't had a chance to try it myself yet) - kind of like the Food Network but in real life and everyone gets to eat the food.

Assuming the weather holds and the schedule doesn't change, the Farmer's Market on Saturdays is laid-back, beautiful and worth a visit.  

You can always walk through the College of William & Mary campus - it's open to the public and beautiful.  There is an art gallery on campus with exhibits that change constantly.

While you're at Yorktown, plan to stop by Yorktown Riverwalk Landing - tiny, but very pretty walking area with shops by the waterfront.

There's also a Ghost Tour...I have no idea if it's any good, but it's been around forever.  Have a great visit."
12470,38149,"Instead of using tapers, use medium-sized pillar candles in glass with enough of a glass neck that they will be protected from the wind.  Then use a long piece of wick or something the length of a fireplace match to light from those pillars to your center unity candle.  We have a facility where we have to use a piece of wick at every ceremony and it works just fine."

12460,66786,"If your having a full wedding dress ask them if they have a fifth door. Usually there is a two hour minimum. You may want to have the bridal party brought to the church in the limo and then you and your love to the reception. If there is no minumum number of hours expect to pay around $150 for the hour including the tip. Some limo drivers get paid by a company and tipping is where they recieve there income. It may seem like a short amount of time for such a good tip, but it takes up the middle of there day and possible longer hours, so I believe it's good to tip. Enjoy your limo drive and have a fun wedding."
12489,66786,"When does he want to get married? He asked you because of his love, check and make sure he is not wanting to have the ceremony sooner. You can always elope and then have the vow renewal in 2010 for the stress of planning a wedding amongst all his other responiblities. My advice for longterm engangements and newlyweds is to honor you loves desires and wishes in making mutual decisions. Many times you will think one thing and your love another... being flexable most of the time will tell your love how much you trust his opinion and help him to be more flexable when the decison is really important to you. Two years to plan for your wedding seems great, as far as event planning goes. Find out all the details and begin the process of creating the wedding of our dreams. Start a blog, it will be fun for friends and family to see your wedding unfold as the time grows closer. I work with couples from two years to a day ahead of time and no time is too long or short. Congratulations !!!"

12489,57903,"I got engaged in December and we are in a pretty similar place with our planning. We are both still in school and we want to graduate before getting married. We are looking at a date in Jan of 2010. I think that once you have in mind what you want your wedding to be like and you have decided on a place you will know how soon you need to set the date. If you want to get married in a very popular place then setting the date soon might be a good idea, but if you are going to get married in a less popular place then there is no rush. I suggest just checking on what the location's suggestions and using that as a guide line."

12515,51824,"That all would depend on how you are with stress and budgeting.  

A wedding planner is supposed to be a buffer for stressful situations whether it be with soon to be in-laws to be or your beloved.  A good wedding planner will have multiple vendors and can sometimes pay for themselves with the vendor discouts they receive from other wedding specialists.  

You should consider it and maybe interview a couple to see how they can help you, find out thier rates (they all vary drastically) and be armed with the hard questions, (which is another great thing, they can accompany you to other interviews armed with these questions you would never think of!) make sure you are content and happy with their answers and remember its okay to sleep on it, its a huge decision and if you find the right person they will totally work with you 100%

GOOD LUCK!!
"
12507,51824,"In my past experience flowers are given to those who stand up for you (in the wedding party) and the parents as well as grandparents.  At times I have had clients make a ""rememberance"" boquet to place at a table or seat to honor those who are no longer with us (table usually for more than one with photos).
If the other family members want flowers let them know its okay to take home a centerpeice with them but it is not necessary to supply them with corsages, boutineers or boquets.
Best of luck to you!!"
12489,26876,"I had a two year engagement, and we set the date right away. Remember venues can get booked pretty far in advance, so if your pretty flexible on dates then you can start looking into venues that interest you and see how open they are for the date you want. Even though you don't plan to get married till 2010, its never too early to start planning, you need all the time you can get, especially if your doing it with no wedding planner. If your on a tight budget you can starting coming up with ideas of things you would want to do yourself, like centerpieces etc. You can start purchasing somethings now and store them for later, it really takes some stress of your pocket as well as on you. If you need any other advice send me a message, I'd be happy to offer you advice. "
12484,26876,"To be honest with you, I think you should go with your gut instinct. If your heart says on a beach watching the sunset, go with that. The less you are influenced by others ideas the more personal and special it will be for the both of you. I mean there is so many ideas, but the more it is YOUR own idea the better, You want to be as original as possible. Good Luck and hope you get your ""yes"""
12507,26876,"Its not required. It also helps distinguish the family from the rest of the guests as well, and not to mention it cacn make them feel special. "
12515,26876,"It really depends, I mean having a planner is an expense in itself, but they can help you stay on budget and other things as well. Unless, you really think you can handle all the responsibilties than go without one. I did, and my day turned out great. I actually had someone help for the day of, and i found him on Craigslist. He did not charge me a dime. Believe me anything they can do you can do too. So if your confident you can do it, than forget the planner.

11942,54566,"You know how your friends and family think. I personally see no problem with it. I would consider how they will feel. Will they have to take time off from work again or travel? The only thing I would say is make it different. I would either do ONLY family so it would be very small and intimate or make it a large more casual affair. You could still dress up but do like a bbq or something inexpensive and fun. Good Luck, sorry your wedding had so much drama. "
12274,54566,"I agree with some of the other ladies. And WOW what a tough spot to be in. I personally would talk to my MOH first just so she knows what is going on. She might prefer that you not say anything because it may make things a bigger deal with the ex and the mutual friends. If your MOH really doesn't want her there then I would ask her not to come. You really don't need the drama and she should understand since the two of you are not close anyway.  If she hasn't received an invite, she was wrong to book a flight in the first place. Who assumes they are coming to a wedding without a STD or invite anyway? If she gets upset OH WELL> it's not about her, the day is about you, your SO and your friends and family.  Good Luck! "

Involve the bridal party, family and friends to help you decorate the ceremony and reception sites and even to make your own floral bouquets, favors, food, etc. I am not located in your area but I am sure there are aspiring coordinators who would love to help!

Last year I lost my grand father, and my brother 3 weeks apart. THIS was very hard for our family...obviously!

What I did on my inserts what I gave directions to the ceremony, and included my wedding website on there. It gave a lot of details about the wedding like what to wear and registry and food. I would do that it'll save you time and not to mention postage, the more inserts you have the more weight you add on to it. Also, you don't want the guests to loose your Response card with having all those inserts. Just add the invitation, Response card and the directions. Any other info you want your guests to know add on to your website and print that on your directions card, that way they wont loose it. "
12563,26876,"I actually did something similar in memory of my grandfather. I had an extra rose that was white put into my bouquet. My bouquet was black magic roses which are red so the single rose stood out. I had a special chair reserved next to my grandmother, it would have been where he would have sat. I pulled the rose out of my bouquet and placed it on his chair as i passed it. I got a lot of questions from guests wondering what was the meaning of the white rose, I just told them it was in memory of my Grandfather. It was very personal and yet everyone witnessed it. Just wanted to give you an alternative idea."

Congratulations of your wedding.  Have you thought about welcome kits for your out of town guests?  Visit www.invitationconcepts.com for more info and please contact me with any questions.  I have a number of new designs that are not on my website yet that I can email to you.  All parts of the wedding welcome kit are also available a la carte.  You can change the colors, ribbons and fonts to really make it your own."

12484,56581,"Being a women, I took the unconventional route when I proposed to my fiance... But when I was thinking about how to pop the question, I thought about our relationship, what would be meaningful to him, and his personality. For example, although he is not shy, he is a relatively private person, so I made sure that we were alone. He doesn't like surprises, so I just told him what he means to me and then asked him to marry me in our hotel room on a trip--no big wow factor in the proposal itself. For the memory-wow factor, we happen to be in Italy visiting a friend of mine at the time. So whatever you choose to do, make sure it matches your relationship and it is something that will be meaningful to you and your partner!!!!"
12553,60300,"I do not know of your age, you should already have an idea of your cycles. Caculate out to your planned wedding date. You should have some what of an idea. As others have mentioned, your OB can assist with different types of BC that can temp assit durig this time frame, or extend to prevent the obvious until you both are ready.  Also keep in mind that due to stress of the wedding, you may end up having your cycle ending up early or just after a recent cycle... it is a never ending story...

Best Wishes"
12489,56581,"Being one year into a two and a half year long engagement, my biggest piece of long engagement advice would be this: be prepared for people to question why you are waiting ""so long"" and have your answer ready to go. Most people assume that once you become engaged that you are going to be married soon and if you are not in this boat, a lot of people are quick to question you. We set a date within a month of getting engaged knowing that it would be at least two years away. Setting a date was something that made us feel better: First, it gave us a sense of what we were in for and how we could best use our time as well as a chance to account for the reasons we wanted to wait. Second, it really came in handy because when those people ask why so long, so not only have your reason, you also have your date picked out for a more concrete time line and it tells them that you are serious about your relationship, which should be a wonderful thing to bring into marriage!!!!"
12563,56581,"Since you are planning this as a surprise for your FH, I would consider doing it at your ceremony with his family. I think it would be more meaningful for your FH and his family to have this sort of thing done in a more private setting. If you are having programs printed, you can always include information about the honor memorial in it. If you are recording your ceremony, it would be a nice touch to show the video at your reception where all your non-family guests would be able to see your ceremony as well as the special memorial. At the reception, you can have a moment of silence, a prayer, a special dance, or something else to honor your FH's father in addition to the intimate family memorial from the ceremony."
12330,11063,"That looks great!  I'm very impressed  :)"
12461,72993,"In my opinion, historic mansion suggests string, perhaps a quartet or quintet. I'm envisioning candles and violins. Very traditional ensemble, but you could request out-of-the-ordinary music selections or arrangements...maybe baroque music for the ceremony and then some cold play and beatles for the cocktail hour.

12597,66563,"I have heard of it, most people do the two(without the rsvp). If your not planning a seating chart type wedding then I personally dont see the reason in an r.s.v.p, but  I know that alot of people do the two so that they won't have to send invitations to the parents or their children, unless the children are married of course lol. But I hope this helps some! Good luck on your wedding! YAY =]"
12254,79937,"Have you thought of getting custom invitations? You don't have to go with something that you have seen but something that is truly your own style with your colors. Your invites should set the tone for what the style of your wedding will be. It doesn't have to specifically match the colors of your wedding but it should match the overall esthetic of it. For example you wouldn't have a whimsical invitation for an art deco/glam inspired wedding."
5544,79937,"Please have a look at our site www.deluxecreativestudio.com. The site is under construction but if you need any information I will be glad to provide it.

12597,50366,"If I am understanding correctly what you are stating:

*Outer envelope to hold everything (this envelope would be addressed
 with the formal name of Mr. & Mrs. John Doe.
*Inner envelope (that does not seal) inside the outer envelope and 
 would hold the invitiation contents.  This envelope would be 
 addressed as ""John, Jane, Judy, Joseph"" etc. (all family members
 that you want to invite.
*THEN inside this inner envelope you would have a RSVP card WITH
 an envelope (this smallest envelope would have your return address 
 printed on it)this is the envelope that will be sent back to you
 with the RSVP card.

So YES there would be THREE envelopes total.  If you would prefer you can forgo having the envelope for the RSVP card and just have a POST CARD RSVP this would be printed on both sides.  One side with the RSVP information, and the other side with your return address so your guest can send it back.

Just remember to put a stamp on the RSVP post cards or RSVP envelopes"

12385,79708,"Hi - Destination Weddings are a very popluar way to save some money. The key is to find the right location that provides the most service for free. Also  Keep in mind that every country has specific marriage laws and fees. Example - Getting married in Italy requires lots of paperwork and can cost upwards of $1000 just in fees, where locations like Jamaica would cost you $200, but lots of resorts will pay the costs for you if you go to their resort. Lot's of opportunities. I am a travel consultant specializing on honeymoons and destination weddings, if you'd like more details, please email or call is we are on wedding wire. All About Honeymoons. I do recommend seeking out a travel consultant, they can take care of all your arrangements and guide you to the right location based on what you're looking for. jack@allabouthoneymoons.com"
11063,79708,"A very tough decision. What ever you decide make sure you have a good insurance policy that includes cancel for any reason (including all your guests)and that you talk to the resort wedding coordinator and ask the questions before you put any money out. You should also use a travel agent. I am a travel consultant, but I'd recommend finding an agent you can sit down with face to face and go over all the options. Sept is a great time to travel in the Caribbean and Mexico (except for the storms). Moving to May will be more costly. If you're loking for a specialists, please contact an All About Honeymoons Consultant, email me if you'd like a contact for your area. jack@allabouthoneymoons.com"
12324,79043,"Hi:  Your cake sounds like a work of art.  In my experience of making wedding cakes, I have noticed that brides choose cake flavors that they themselves love to eat.  That's great, but you will have to remember to TRY to please everyone.  I found that the three most common crowd pleasers are party white, marble or chocolate...of these three you can put almost any combination of fillings for variety.  Cake is pretty ordinary, but the fillings will jazz it up.  The other thing I have noticed over the years is that men love chocolate.  If they see plain white cake it will be ignored.  A little chocolate or chocolate filling and the men are happy.  Some bakeries will allow you to have every tier to be a different flavor. Ask about it.  The only filling that tends to flop at a wedding is lemon curd...it is a mystery.  Odd flavors like Kahlua, spice or almond paste are also slow movers.  Stick with the simple and you will always get it right."
12602,26876,"I think if you go that route consider using the flameless candles. Having lit candles throughtout your ceremony gives it a nice look but having it in the evening/night will also mean that they may blow out, unless you have hurricanes, but then thats another investment. I'd have a little of both, real candles and flameless candles especially if they are going to be near guests, the last thing you want is a fire at your ceremony. Also, have you considered buying stringed lights to go with your candles?"
12597,26876,"Yes, there are three inner, outer and response envelopes. Remember to include a postage stamp on your response envelope and to have it self addressed to you. The outer has the Mr. and Mrs. names on it, the inner can just have the names no Mr. and Mrs. of all who is invited in that family. And the response well I assume you get what its for, but incase not, its so that your guest can mail the response back to you.  "
12256,79043,"Hi:   Great question.  I have seen a lot of trends come and go over the years.  The bride/groom figures are so out, very 1950s and expensive.  They are great if you want to replicate your mothers wedding cake for a theme.  My big thing is saving money...simple is elegant and less is more.  So I tell my brides to choose some loose flowers that match her bouquet and have them in a bucket of water.  When I go to deliver it is so easy to arrange a small topper in fresh flowers.  To have one ready made by the florist can be expensive too.  Some florists will make up a small 5 inch nose gay with a small wrapped stem.  I wrap the stem in seran wrap and push it into the top cake...later it can be pulled out and used as a toss bouquet.  That still can be expensive as compared to some loose roses and greens arranged on and around the cake.  Greens are very important for your photos.  Green separates the white table cloth from the white cake and makes your photos snap sharp. "

12553,39625,"If you are on birth control, you can always do what I did. I visited my obgyn, I was prescribed Seasonale, and she had me start my birth control so that for all 3 of my weddings I won't have my period at all. We also sat down with a calendar and wrote down the week number I should be on according to the dates on the calendar, so that I knew when exactly I would have my period.

Also, there's a couple days variation, about 3. 

Science is the key to your cycle.
And you can quote me on that.

Future MD."
12562,39625,"Ok,
it's not Christmas, or Easter where people tend to be with family the whole holiday season. It's labor day weekend, where lots of people tend to travel, but it's more than acceptable to hold your wedding that weekend.  

Just be sure that a hotel near your reception, will have room to accommodate out of town guests. And maybe include guest room gifts, like water bottles and attraction brochures from the area, so that guests can also make it a vacation.

Send out save-the-date cards, including your name and date. No other details are necessary. 

Best of Luck!"
12594,39625,"Just be honest. Just because you're friends with someone does not mean they get the honor of being a groomsman.  You can always explain to them nicely, that you want people who were more involved in getting you guys together up at the alter by your side.
Good Luck!"
12597,39625,"If you want to follow etiquette. You do not need 3 envelopes.
2 is more than sufficient. You would just formally address the outer envelope.

Mr. and Mrs. Orange Rum
Four Green Street
Southington, Connecticut 60005

Also your return address would be on that outer envelope:
Three Hundred Mayfield Road
Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
K1G 3U7

Then there's the RSVP envelope that goes also, which is addressed to you.
Miss Cherisse R.
Three Hundred Mayfield Road
Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
K1G 3U7

Now what your mother in law is talking about - is that way back people used to use a cheap ugly outer envelope to address, and then personalize the pretty interior envelope. (For example: Uncle Freckles)
Hope that helped you out. My mother was the same way till I bought her Crane & Co. Blue Book!
Hope that helped!
Good Luck Cherisse!"

12561,39625,"For a symphonic trio or quartet for 3 hours is around $900. (It all depends, since those prices are normally from actual members of a Symphony)

If budget is of great concern, one place you can have a look at is your local university, alot of those students need cash and would probably do an entire evening for under $500.

You want something tasteful for your ceremony, and depending on your taste you can have them play during the dinner part of the reception.

Good Luck!

12595,39625,"My fiance thought it was insane to have a photographer at each of our weddings, but when I spoke to Tammy, our photographer here, and told her our budget + what we wanted. She said it wasn't a problem.

She's totally awesome and I can't wait to work with her on our Cincinnati Wedding.

We aren't in a hurry to decide. My only hurry is that I want to make sure that we get the photographer we want Sherrlyn Borkgren. I've seen her work and  am a big follower and fan.

    I say if black & white is what moves you, go for it! Late October, 4pm...it will be dark or almost dark! I've seen beautiful fabrics, cakes, invites, etc. with gorgeous black/white scroll or filigree patterns. You could always color it up a bit with your flowers!! Add some lavenders, soft pinks...or use deep reds for drama!! For your BM's, pick a nice knee lenght ""little black dress"" (but NOT satin). That way, you get the look you want, and they can use their dresses again. "

Then have your napkins in one of the soft colors.

I just photographed two barefoot weddings. The bride said she didn't care what people wore as long as they didn't come in shoes. (ha ha) 
Chairs are appropriate since they will need to sit while waiting for you and groom.

Just remember that you can't do anything on the sands or water that will hurt the environment.  Maybe you can get some coconuts to lay around and people could drink from them later. Get a sunset calendar there is one on my website to see what time the sunsets on your wedding day. If you are looking for a beach photographer give me a call 541 484 4860

12561,80210,"I'm a wedding musician and I can tell you that you definitely get what you pay for!  Look for musicians who specialize in weddings because there's a lot more to it than just playing well.  You want someone who will make sure that the timing is correct, and that you and your wedding party are comfortable and happy during your ceremony.  Really good quartets in my area are around $950.00, and if that's outside your budget, think a little creatively and consider a smaller group, like a duo or trio which will cost less.  Also look at groups who can do more than one aspect of your wedding (ceremony and cocktails, for example) so that you can maximize the dollars you do spend.  If you are on a very tight budget, you can often find college students who will do a good job for you for less money than full-time professionals.  The main thing is to find someone with whom you are comfortable working in a price range that won't break you.  Good luck!"
12620,46106,"I've heard people say that you ""must"" have professional makeup done, but I don't really think that's true.  It's important to acknowledge that it should be photo-friendly makeup rather than your day-to-day look.  As long as you keep that in mind, I'd think you could be okay doing your own.

I decided to compromise.  I'm having a destination wedding, so couldn't do a run through, and I've had some really bad experiences with makeup artists in the past.  I didn't want the morning of my wedding day to be a trial run.  So, I scheduled an ""instruction"" session with a professional close to home who I really like.  She spent about an hour with me picking out colors, showing me how to apply everything and giving me lots of tips.  Now I have all the stuff so I can practice and hopefully be prepared to do my own makeup and look awesome on the big day.

"
12597,46106,"If you want RSVP's, it seems to me you have 3 options:

1) Include an envelope for the RSVP - self-addressed and stamped
2) Have a postcard style RSVP - also self-addressed and stamped
3) Have people RSVP online

To me, it seems rude to include an RSVP card and expect your guests to buy an envelope, address it themselves and pay for postage.

If I'm reading correctly, it was suggested below that you leave out the inner envelope with the more familiar names.  That doesn't make much sense to me because a) The inner envelope lets you include the extras like children's names or ""and Guest,"" which you wouldn't put on the mailing envelope and b) They're pretty =)

I think if you want to go with just 2, there should be an outter and an inner with a postcard or online RSVP.

Just my thoughts. =)"
12614,56581,"I am a huge fan of dark purple! I don't think it'll look silly with light yellow, I would just be concerned about it overpowering a pale yellow. Personally, I usually pair dark purple with gold--and I think that is a amazing combination. Throw in some light yellow, and it would work. One way to see how different colors will go together is to go to a paint or home improvement store and look at color swatches, but whatever you decide, go with what ever you like!!!!"

12620,56581,"You do not have to have your makeup ""professionally"" done for your wedding day, especially if you were not happy with the result. I think the idea of having your makeup done is more along the lines of pampering yourself and not having to lift a finger on your wedding day.

Brides and grooms who foot the bill for their big day is becoming more and more common each year.  Something that I have suggested to clients who want to make it clear that they are hosting but don't want to leave out their families is to word the invitation as follows:

Together with their families
BRIDE
and 
GROOM
invite you to share in their joy
as they exchange vows

(and you can take it from there)

This way, it is clear that YOU are inviting your guests.

If your families are not involved you can say something like,

We invite you to share in our joy as we,
BRIDE
and
GROOM
exchange marriage vows...

12630,11063,"I really like your color choices!  It sounds very rich and pretty.  Make sure you balance it out enough with the lavendar and soft pink flowers so that it's not too neutral  :)  It sounds lovely!"
12619,11063,"We are also paying for the wedding ourselves, but especially since we have children we wanted our wording to reflect that it's still a family/community event.  Our invitations are worded (as was already suggested):

Together with their families,
me
and
him
Invite you to share in the joy
and celebration of their marriage
On ......

Good luck!"
12613,11063,"When I got married the first time, I had both of my parents walk me down the aisle, and I had one on each side (we did a jewish processional, basically).  If your aisle is wide enough, I would have one on each side, but that's totally up to you!"
12650,73454,"our church has the same rules....besides what you mentioned I'm not sure of any other alternatives."
12650,58465,"i read this on another wedding site and the only option I read was:  to ring bells"
12650,26876,"I had streamers that I found at Michaels(a craft store), the metallic streamers where attatched to the canister which you pop, so you pop and you dont have to worry about picking up afterwards, unless people get careless and rip them. It was about $20 for about 14. Look into that, and also ask if thats an option as well. other than that, there isant much that can be suggested. I understand the no seed, rice or petals policy they have, more and more churches have that. "
12650,72519,"I too have that problem but like someone else said bells are a great alternative! I got the idea from a magazine and they used beautiful silver hand bells (Not Jingle Bells, unless you're getting married near the Holidays). They put little tags around the handle that had ""well wishes"" to the bride and groom on them...I wanted something different (other than bubbles and birdseed) and fell in love with this idea! Hope it helps!
"
12585,15807,"I am having my wedding there in June. The lowest price they offered was $75.00, which is for off peak months and days other than Saturdy (my wedding is on Friday, so it is 75 per person). For a Satruday in peak wedding season, I think it was about 85 or so, which depends on if it is buffet or sit down (mine is buffet, sit down is more expensive). To have the ceremony there it is only 250. They are really nice there and so far I have been very happy with them!! 
Hope this helps!"
12604,80184,"Both of you are stressed. The time is rapidly approaching, and your time has been filled with nothing but wedding errands, wedding chores, and wedding talk..right? Okay...so you're like weeks from the wedding...is there ONE evening that you two can have a nice quiet dinner...even if its in jammies watching movies...and make a rule...absolutely NO wedding talk for the evening. Relax, talk about when you first met, the fun you had getting to know each other. Have a glass of wine(if that's your thing) give each other a massage...even a good foot rub is nice. Just have some quiet time to remember why you're putting yourselves through the chaos....laugh about it!! Sounds like you'll survive!! Best wishes!!"
12489,38515,"Welcome to the club!! LoL. You've got some good advice already. I would say be prepared to get antsy. I thought I would be able to deal with and over 2 year engagement, but man... I got so antsy!! Especially after we set the date. Just remember depending on the date you might want to book as early as you can especially if you want a certain date. We are getting married on Valentine's Day of next year and once we figured out the date we wanted we booked it (it was like 18 months in advance). But make sure it's what you want. I kinda wished I would've waited just so I could play around with other ideas, but my fiance and I both liked the place so we booked it. Also, start saving now (if you're paying for anything) I was suprised at how quick we saved up money, but every little bit counts. And if you do book early, be preparred for people to look at you funny, or even to say you shouldn't book yet, or you can't book yet. Good Luck!!"
12562,38515,"I think you should be okay. Our wedding is on Valentine's Day and as far as I know everyone we really wanted to come is comming and the few 'extra' guest that we had to invite might or might not. You just have to know that the people closest to you will try their best to come. We sent out Save-The-Date magnets recently as a reminder for our guest so if they do want to attend, they can plan accordingly. Good Luck!!"

12607,30382,"Hi ,
 I am a florist here on the Wedding Wire.
Even though this is a Biker theme, Its still a wedding
Dont make it tacky, Even Bikers love quality.
Dont dye the flowers!!
If you have to go for silks
go to AFLORAL.com and look for some.

I did a fun biker wedding with lots of pretty fresh Gebera daisies in Harley orange with black centers. ALL natural.
 they holdup well and can be done easliy.
 Try this look.
black bud vases, available online, tie with gold ribbon.
 
For chairs, you can add a Corset look to the backs of the VIP chairs with laced up leather look wraps. Very cool.
DONT use plastic tablecloths!
rent some black cloth ones and add some fun touches like amber votives.Think Road house chic'!

Rent a black and white checkered dance floor too, Your guests will love it and you can have a couple of your friends with the best bikes add them for a backdrop to the cake area!

Favors! Cello favor bags with your color jelly bellies and a cool card with your theme "
12655,11063,"I wish I could offer you some help in this arena.  Even though I love my strapless dress, I did have a hard time finding something that was a bit different than the mainstream.  I agree that wedding dresses seem to be very generic, Barbie doll strapless monstrosities these days.  There are exceptions, but it seems to be the rule right now.  My future sister-in-law was having the same issues, because she wanted a dress with *gasp* sleeves.  We are also second timers, and not exactly a size 2.  Ultimately, she's having to have her dress made for her in order to get a style that she likes.  The only alternative to that that I would offer is to look for dresses and talk to the seamstress in the shop and see if she could add sleeves to it.  Most dresses can have them added without too much trouble.  Good luck to you, and try to have some fun in your dress shopping!"
12657,52913,"You are at the point in your planning where you need a planner. The purpose of a planner is to alleviate the stress that wedding planning can cause and allow you to enjoy your day and the entire process that is associated with it. I have been event/wedding planning professionally for a little over 4 years, but when I got married 7 years ago I didn't have a planner. I went through the same thing you are going through. So I made a vow to myself that I did not want another bride to have to be stressed about planning their wedding!
The average rates of a planner can range from $25.00/hr to as much as hundreds of dollars an hour for the more elite planner. But we do offer packages and they can be as low as $300.00 to as much as 20% of the entire budget. Enquire about planners who are available for a price that you can afford. In the end, I am sure you will see that the investment was well worth it!
Happy Planning!

12686,46106,"Since you're having a destination wedding and a lot of your guests are traveling (did I read Switzerland in another post?), I'd send them out as soon as you possibly can - by the middle of April at the latest.  July sounds far away, but it's not really for travel planning.  You want to allow people plenty of time to find decent rates on airline tickets, book accommodations, etc."
11247,79708,"There are several all inclusive locations that are reasonalbe to get to in the Caribbean and in Mexico. The hotel zone in Cancun and some of the areas south provide what your looking for (safe and fairly inexpensive). Palace Resorts and Karisma properties in Mexico are fantastic and reasonably priced for what you get. Some great adult only properties. Also, USVI is great and there are some reasonalby priced resorts, though not too many all inclusive. St Lucia is a great location, but can be a bit expensive depending on the travel dates. December isn't too bad as long as it's early. jack@allabouthoneymoons.com"
11391,79708,"You might consider Royal PLantation in Jamaica - Technically there are no private beaches in Jamaica - the location of this property makes its beaches in accessable to others. You would have to share it with other guests, but the resort is small. You may consider a private house as an option. jack@allabouthoneymoons.com"
12686,70291,"Well, the people that are coming from really far away (Switzerland) already know about the wedding.  There are a lot of people we are inviting but not really expecting to show up.  Our total headcount will be between 30-40, with 15 from Vermont, where our wedding will be. "
12430,78724,"Thank you for looking up this dress for me. I did see the posting but I still cant afford it. Unfortunately, I did an impulse purchase a few months ago and purchased a beautiful dress. It bit into my dress budget and I now need to sell it before making another purchase :-(

oh well...the dress search continues."
12657,4007,"You are the perfect candidate to hire a wedding planner! I would suggest a package that at least includes vendor confirmations, rehearsal and day of direction, and perhaps even some assistance with selecting vendors. Just as an FYI I charge $900-1100 for my packages that includes that(they're called Gracious and grand on my website if you wanted an idea of what's included.) I'm on the opposite coast, but at least it gives you a realistic idea of what to expect. I would definately want someone local who has a fair amount of experience who will be there from start to finish. I'd also ask if they would consider themselves ""hands on."" For example, I'm told that many coordinators show up 15 min. before the ceremony & leave after dinner service begins. In contrast, my staff & I are generally there two hours before the ceremony & leave once the site is in the shape it needs to be per the contract (which varies, depending on if they have their own maintenence staff or not.)Hope that helps!"
12650,4007,"If its daytime, bubbles are always cute. You could get the ball rolling by renting or purchasing an inexpensive bubble machine. 

Butterflies look amazing if its warm enough outside when you have your wedding. 

Sparklers are fantastic and are legal in most states because they are classified as a ""novelty"" rather tha a firework. Check with the church and the local fire marshall first. Better to get the more expensive metal handled long burning kind, and make sure to have containers of wet sand for the spent sparklers."
12653,4007,"Absolutely! A simple white or ivory panel card is a traditional& classy invitation, & its very inexpensive. Have your local printer print them. I also designed a tri-fold card for a client that had the invitation, their picture & the reception card all on one paper with two ink colors, two sided printing and the card stock was sage on the outside, ivory inside. We sealed them with a foil seal & addressed them (no envelopes at all!) The cost for 350 invitations was $400
Flowers - costco either bulk or their package
Hall - around here there are granges that have large wooden floored halls for $125 to $500."

12678,4007,"Even if its not you first, its you last, right? Make it fabulous, memorable, and special. I love second weddings, actually, because the couple is usually more mature & realizes that this is a special thing. If your heart desires the big wedding deal - go for it! BTW - the copper colored pics on my site & storefront were her 2nd wedding, his first. It was goregeous!!"
12657,67772,"I agree, I would def hire a planner since you cannot possibly be around to deal with all the small details.  Make sure you have an in-person initial meeting with him/her & it seems liek someone you can trust & work well with.  Good luck!!"
12626,67772,"Since you cannot have people RSVP to the rehearsal dinner on the wedding wire site, maybe you should send out an evite (www.evite.com).  They are very simple to make on that site, just make sure you select the option that does not allow guests to bring other guests...b/c may start RSVPing for them, their friend, their husband & everyone else...lol.

We are inviting only wedding party memebrs, our parents and the officiant/his wife to the rehersal dinner...no spouses of anyone else or boyfriends/girlfriends.  "
12678,67480,"Congratulations on your engagement and your upcoming wedding. I have been on both sides of this question as a wedding coordinator and as a  Bride ( I was married a second time myself just last year) 

It is a wonderful feeling to wear the white dress and have friends and family in attendance for your special day. However, each couple has their own unique ""version of the wedding vision"" therefore you should talk to your groom and develop the vision that best reflects the two of you ( regardless of what you did in your previous wedding) And if having a big traditional wedding is for you then so be it! If you would like something more intimate and low key then do that. 

As long as it is what you and your future husband want then it is a perfect vision for the two of you! Best Wishes, Doreen DiLeoanrdo , Party Doll Events .com         "
12403,67480,"Candles are a great and inexpensive way to set the mood for any special occasion especially a wedding reception. I would suggest pillar candles of different heights. YOu may consider colored pillars if you have a color scheme to add to the decor and incoporate rose petals piled around them----try to get a base such as a mirror or platform under the candles so it has a finished look. 

There are many stores like Michaels here in NY that have inexpensive pillar candles as well as the dollar stores. 

Good luck,

12700,52913,"I would say that its not proper to ask them to host a party. Traditionally the brides parents host the initial engagement party, but both sets of parents can throw one party together if they choose to do so.
If you want to let your church family know that you are engaged and make the wedding date known, maybe you could speak with the pastor and ask him what would be best. Since you are members of your church maybe your pastor would like to do something on his own. I would leave this up to him and the members. 
This is my opinion on the matter, but I hope you find a resolution that works out!

12256,63713,"I'm actually a professional wedding cake baker and honestly bride and groom figurines are not as trendy as handmade sugar bow or sugar flowers (those you can keep). Fresh flowers have very nice effect on your cake or consider monogram as a topper with Swarovski crystal, very elegant! If you decide to go with bride and groom topper, get a nice porcelain topper but please make sure to let your baker to know the dimension and weight of your topper to avoid collapse. If you would like check out our website for some ideas www.celsoscakes.com  "
12515,78352,"I would highly recommend getting a wedding planner. I personally have had some friends that thought they would be able to do without a planner and completely regretted it after the fact! It is quite a bit of money that you have to set aside for a planner but the outcome is worth the money. Also, if you really think about it, you are actually saving more money by having a wedding planner. The amount of discounts, rates, and quality of services (vendors) that you will get with a planner isn't possible without one! Also, if you want to do it yourself, I would still suggest to have a day-of-coordinator. People often overlook what is going to happen on the day of and not have anyone in charge of the coordination. Really think about it, its definitely worth the time and money that you will save!"
12657,62458,"You should definitely invest in a planner!  At this point in your planning, you won't be able to do it all by yourself remotely.  A good planner will be able to tailor a package for you that will fit into your budget, not go over and beyond it.  Look for someone who has done destination weddings before.  Just speak with them and tell them everything that you need, what your vision is, etc.  And if you'd like them to be onsite, be prepared to compensate them for travelling expenses.  Good luck!"
12620,62458,"Don't concentrate so much on it being a ""professional"" as it being someone who does a good job.  That's if you feel the need to have someone else do it at all.  If you feel comfortable doing it yourself and it's something that you do well and often, go ahead.  But some brides are so overwhelmed on the day of, that they'd rather not worry with it.  You could have it done at the cosmetic counter in the mall, which is normally free, or you could find an independent beauty consultant like a Mary Kay, Avon or Beauti Control rep.  They will usually apply it free as well, if you purchase the products.  Good luck!"

12713,8287,"Payment of the bridal dress is totally at the discretion of the bride.  It is very common place for the wedding party to pay for their own clothes and a gift from the bride could be the jewelry, flowers, etc.  It goes either way based on the budget of the bride and groom.  I have coordinated weddings where it was done either way.  Your option sounds good or you could have them pay for their dresses and you pay for the shoes (less money)  It is just a matter of knowing your bridesmaids, they probably wouldn't mind either way.

12604,70212,"Hi sockfuzz,

I agree with julsdanne. You guys need to get away from the wedding business and have fun. Get out on a date, go out for a few beers and shoot pool or something really light and casual. But not a movie...do something together that's completely carefree. 

Keep us updated!

Breidie"
12700,8287,"An engagement party although nice is not a mandatory event.  If someone choses to gift hosting this event for you I would definitely welcome it but to ask someone or a body of people to host it for you may invoke ill feelings as to your motive behind ""asking"" for a party to be thrown in you and your fiance's honor.  I think if your church has a directory, I would suggest to have postcards made with your photo on it along with Save the Date informtion on the ack of it and either mail it out (the best option) or when you go to church give it to those people that you will invite to your wedding.  There will be enough events up to your wedding that will take place for you that this is really a minute issue.

12711,11063,"I think that your first song choice has to be something that really speaks to you guys in one way or another.  My best friend and her husband had a very sweet slow song, then halfway through it the DJ cut to a crazy, upbeat song and they just started bouncing around.  It was memorable to me because it fit their personalities so well.  I wish I had some specific ideas for you, I'm sorry!  Andy and I chose our first song because we both heard the lyrics and said ""Oh my gosh, that's us.  We have to do it.""  So, our choice was pretty easy!

Good luck to you, and hang in there!  We don't have much longer to go, and it will all come together beautifully."
12568,8287,"Keep in mind their technology savy.  I think to be considerate of all your guests all information should be in the invitation packet.  As an invitation specialist, the invitation sets the tone for your event.  You can always direct them to your site for ""little"" stuff but information that is crucial for your wedding should be in the packet...invite, response, registry, maps, etc.  Your love story, your bridal party, etc. is all acceptable to the website incuding the same information you put in the invitation.

I think as brides ""we"" allow technology to do alot and take away from the beauty and elegance of the wedding ritual.

Rose"
12353,8287,"Hello Keesta, as an invitation expert my advice to you is utilize the Save the Date to be just that an FYI of your upcoming nuptials with names, date and time with additional info to follow.

If you have out of town guests, I would suggest sending them additional information in the mail that would talk about the whole hotel, car, travel information.

When your invitation goes out that is exactly what it is supposed to do....invite.  The invitation sets the tone for your wedding and it is not impressive taking out an invitation with other stuff falling out that has nothing to do with you inviting that guest to the wedding.

Also if you have a website, use it for an addendum or a refresher to what you have sent already.  I would advise not to use the website in place of anything.

12713,26876,"i think its more common to hear the BM's and MOH pay for their own attire. The bride can most certainly pitch in if she wants. "
12713,50366,"It is rare that the bride pays for these items.  They are suppose to pay for their own.  If they are your friends and relatives, they know you well enough that you would not be able to afford to dress them.  "
12700,50366,"I don't think that it is appropriate to ask them to throw you a party.  If you would like to throw yourself a party (or your parents) maybe you could ask the church to allow you to have it at their facility free of cost or a small donation.  

Another thought would be to put the announcement in the bulletin, or if your church asks for announcements or prayers and concerns - you could raise your hand and stand up and announce your engagement and wedding date - the most surely will be happy for you! :-)  Congratulations."

12403,48751,"I am working on a wedding for May and we're doing bud vases as the certerpieces with Gerbera Daisies in them, but the great thing about it is they are also the guest favors.  The bride has been collecting the vases from thrift stores mostly, so it has been inexpensive, and it saves on favors.  You could do the same with candlesticks.  Place a mirror in the center of the table and get candlesticks in your wedding colors.  Place them on the mirror for the reception and invite your guests to take one home-with the mirror, once people take the candlesticks, it's not totally empty.  "
12327,39709,"I would put them IN the vase (in mass). The stems can go into them. We have done that before. You could also take the pearls off the strands and do it...
Another thought is to take the pearls off and bead them onto a piece of floral wire. You can then stick this into the arrangmenets and bend them into shapes...sort of like twigs."
12146,39709,"In my opinion. I would stay away from black in the flowers themselves. My suggestion.  Black bacarra roses, white stock, white hydrangea, white lisianthus. Wrap the stems in black satin if you wish. Another August option is Dahlias in reds/whites...lovely seasonal flower."
11769,39709,"First I would suggest having the reception site put IVORY tablecloths instead of white if you have the choice, it won't be so stark. This way the overlay will blend better. Clay pots (about $2.00 each) filled with leaves and pears/apples. Scatter crab apples on the tables and put out at least 7 votives. Another suggestion is a lily bowl with floating dahlias, they are great for floating and come in very pretty fall shades. You could put pebbles in the bottom, you can also have the dahlias AND floating candles together. My opinion, you can never have too many candles.
Good luck!"
11631,39709,"You can't get tulips in August. (at least I can't)
My opinion-Crimson red stock, red freesia, red gerberas, Red hypericum berries, callas(they are expensive), spray roses...(instead of regular roses.)
Good luck!"

Time is very important.
Congradulations!

12732,30180,"I don't know how much they would cost, but if you dont really want to be stressed out about differents things, then I say hire one. Otherwise, your wedding isn't until May of next year, you can go ahead and get all the information for the things that you are going to need (like flowers, ccake, dresses, shoes, location for wedding and reception), find out the cost and set a time for yourself to call everyone to have everything for that day ready with no mistakes.

At my best friend's shower (which I hosted along with the other BM's), she got both things off the registry (household products, etc.) and things for her like scented candles and a gift certificate for a massage."
12726,39625,"You poor thing! I come from a Mediterranean background, and they don't understand Adults Only Reception either. 

What we did so people got it clear was let our parents and siblings know that theirs a babysitting company that will come to the hotel and watch their kids. It's a little price to pay as bride and groom, so we will be footing along with dinner for children, especially since our guests are traveling from more than 8hours. 

If your having your reception in a hotel, or somewhere nearby, you might want to see if you can do the same. My nieces and nephews are looking forward to the mountain of ice cream, pizza, movies and the hour long limo ride we have planned for them that evening. They gagged when they saw the menu, so that might be another way to convince parents the reception isn't for children.

Hope that helped, and best of Luck!"

12743,39625,"Hey, I've got a few ideas.
Have you ever seen the button cake by Martha Stewart? Well you can do the same just with puzzle pieces: http://www.marthastewart.com/photo-gallery/a-slice-of-heaven?lnc=8b99cf380e1dd010VgnVCM1000005b09a00aRCRD&rsc=lpg_weddings&currentslide=5&currentChapter=1&chapterCounter=6&lpgStart=1&adnumber=1#lpg

http://www.favorideas.com/shopping/index.php
http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=609&pq-locale=en_US
You can get vases and fill the bottoms with puzzle pieces, and put flowers in of course. It's silly things like that, that when people notice they'll be talking about how neat it was.
Your place cards can be puzzle pieces with calligraphy names - you can either visit a stationer or hit a craft store for blank puzzle pieces.
You could also have your invitations in puzzle shapes (just enlarged enough to fit the wording)
Hope this helped! Good Luck!"
12697,39625,"A bridal shower, is normally only for women to attend, and it's usually gifts for the bride (like kitchen stuff, linens, house items, money and even lingerie)

Now a wedding shower, typically thrown before the bridal shower(or at least in my family), acts as a sort of engagement party. It's a chance for your entire family to get together and meet the groom to be. In my family no matter what the event title they always give money, so I'm unsure of gift etiquette at a wedding shower in any other cases.

I hope this helps in some way.
Best of Luck. "

However, on the flip side, I was in a wedding where I had to pay for everything and the jewelry was a gift. If you have more than one bride's maid, you might have them pay for their stuff. It's so common to do that nowadays. My mother just wouldn't hear of it because in ""her day"" the bride and groom dressed everyone head to toe."

I've asked him to be officially in the Wedding Party, if that helps. 
"
12759,23792,"Have you done a search on other forums to see how other couples rated their services/venue?

Have you looked on the Better Business Bureau website to see if they have negative marks against them?  By the way, this is a great idea when you are considering a vendor that did not come as a recommendation.

Chances are they are busy and not the best at returning your calls, and whatever that may say about their professionalism, it is probably not an indication that you are being stiffed.  I would ask that they draw up a contract even if it is not their business practice, and maybe even ask for some referrals.  I am asked for referrals all of the time, and I hear horror stories all of the time, so I completely understand and I am happy to give them.  Vendors these days are aware of the power of the bad forum review!

Good luck!

12250,45809,"I have a couple quick ideas for your reception:
since you're going to name each of the table after the different monuments then you could have each of the tables with a centerpiece that represents that monument, you could take pictures of the monuments (Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, Capitol Building, Jefferson Memorial) and frame each picture then place 1 in the middle of the each table and surround them with candles and/or flower.
as wedding gifts you could give out monument shot glasses, t shirts, etc...

Well that's just a couple quick ideas...

12732,12320,"A wedding planner can save you time, money, and the STRESS of planning a wedding.Let's face it, this is the day you have dreamt of since you were a little princess. Save yourself the headache of dealing with proper etiquette, vendors, and other details. Sit back and enjoy your day and let your wedding planner handle the rest."
12614,31333,"That combination is great!  A 3rd color might not be necessary.  And it's good for an august or september wedding but also good for an april wedding too.  Just depending on what shade of dark purple you choose.  But go for it!"
12653,31333,"Getting the invitations from Wal-Mart is a good idea.  One of my friends recently got some and they were on clearance for $4.50 for a box of 50 I think.  Also, in the craft section, (this would be fun to do, too!) they have plain veils for about $10 and can decorate it with beads and rhinestones or something.  They also have some cheap cute tiaras.  And you can also have your wedding cake baked at Wal-Mart or get the different shaped cake pans (also in the craft section) and bake your own cake or have someone else do it for you.  There are lots of things you can do to save money.  When it gets closer to my wedding, I'm gonna be hitting the aisles of Wally World lol.  Also buying a bunch of silk flowers and floral tape to make your own bouquets and boutineres and corsages is a good money-saver.  You can make a fun time out of it too.  Invite your bridesmaids over and have them put together their own bouquets and the boutineres and corsages.  Order pizza and cut up and have fun! "
12732,11063,"I think it depends on the anticipated size and extravagance of your wedding, as well as how much you're looking to spend.  I'm having a smaller wedding, and it's not very formal, so I'm doing it myself.  To be honest, I would be doing it myself even if it were big and formal.  I don't have $20,000 to $100,000 to spend on a wedding, so the cost of a wedding planner seems very unnecessary to me.  It also depends on how much time you have and what your stress level is like.  If you work a crazy amount of hours at work, then you may want a planner just because of how little time you have to plan it.  I realize I may ruffle some feathers, and I am against current trends, but in my opinion people are making too much of the wedding day itself rather than the resulting marriage.  Yes, it's a very special and important day for me and my family, and I want it to be nice, but it's still just one day of my life.  I have no desire to go into debt for one day of my life.  Just my two cents, sorry!"

12759,21205,"1st things first, Congrats on your upcoming wedding (Im getting married 3 days after you)! 2nd thing, calm down and it will be ok.  3rd thing, hiring a planner to handle most of the stress would be a really great investment. I think talking to your parents is a good idea, just to let them know whats going on and in case something happens they have your back.  i wouldnt cancel just yet.  i would wait to see what they have to offer when you go and visit them, and then if you still arent feeling at peace with the situation, then do what you have to do. But keep in mind that since your wedding is in July, finding an available venue might be a little tough...hope this helps you some!!!"
12707,21205,"awww...congrats!!!! many blessings to you, your husband and your little one!!!"
12750,26876,"If your concerned about it, then do something. Be the first to break the ice and call her up, tell her your sorry about the way things have been. Even if you had no fault at all, if you apologize you become the bigger person. I really don't see a big problem, the only issue is who initiates first. AS far as the congratulations go, even if you dont verbally hear it, does not mean they don't care. Sometimes one word is all it takes, ""sorry""."
12763,26876,"It may sound really bad, but I've seen a few rehearsal dinners at Dave & Busters at White Flint mall, and they looked like they were having fun. Its a nice casual atmosphere where you can dine and play. But, also you haven't mentioned where in MD you'd like to consider. "

Ok, now with that out of the way.  If you want her to be there, call her and talk to her.  Explain the rumor and what actually happened.  See what she has to say.  Talking might be painful, but it will be worth it to have her in your life, involved in your wedding, there to see possible kids, etc.  The longer you let this go, the worse it will get."

12712,81692,"I am a wedding photographer on the Gulf Coast and have seen every kind of beach wedding from small budget to extremely large.  All can be beautiful and not much money spent.  On our beaches, we need a $25 county permit for the day.  You do not need chairs. I would use vegetation rather than fake flowers and you can make a runway with bamboo or just palm frawns stuck in the sand.  An arch can be made from Bamboo stalks and a cloth tied to 4 of them make it look very Tahitian.  Plan the wedding at sunset with one instrament playing (violin is very nice) Sax or guitar work well also.  Get your friends to help make the bouquets.  Great flowers are found at Trader Joes and you can get ribbon anywhere.  Just bunch and tie. If you pay attention you can have a lovely natural Tahitian style wedding on a dime.  Take a look at some of my photos on my website for some ideas  www.goodegreen.com or www.sheilagoode.com  For the reception, go to a park and set up a tropical reception."
12759,36988,"When you visit this weekend, I would definitely suggest getting a contract just to ensure that you get everything you have discussed with your contact at the lodge.  I'm sure everything is fine, but its always nice to have that contract as backup!

Good luck with the planning!
"
12771,26876,"Actually, you don't open gifts at your reception. Usually, the bestman along with the groomsmen pack all the gifts into the designated car for you two to open in the privacy of your home or whatever. And the reason why, is its a wedding, no one ever opens gifts at a wedding, it would seem so tacky not to mention would take up time, Especially if you have a lot of gifts. "
12759,49399,"I think that since you are not close to where you are getting married, you may want to invest in a planner to take care of things for you.  A good planner will not allow you to deal on a handshake and a smile.  They make sure things are taken care of in writing.  Also, you are stressed enough just hoping things go correctly.  The planner will allow you to relax some and make sure the day of the wedding goes smoothly as well.  

My advice is to interview at least two (maybe three) and get quotes from them.  Be sure they outline what they can do for you.  You can pick or make up your own list of services you would like.  Then you should weigh your costs with the services and your comfort level with the planners with whom you have met.  That will help you to make an informed decision.

Congratulations and good luck!"

12750,69406,"wow... can i be nosy and ask what the rumor was?  hehe.  i mean, was it about her?  why would she not talk to you for so long?  that must be awkward!  

i would maybe write her a letter (thats what i would do, i'm a chicken) and tell her how much you miss her and would really like her to be here for you (focus on the positive, not just about the past).  offer to have her over for coffee or something so you can discuss it further, and if she brings up the rumor then, you can explain how it was false...  i wouldn't bring that up in the letter though.
Good luck!  you sound very sweet and i think the whole thing was probably a terrible misunderstanding...

12771,67772,"Normally you don't open the gifts at the wedding, but I have seen before on a show where the couple needed money to pay their vendors so they had their planners open up the cards with moeny & take out the money & document the amount they took from each card to pay the vendors.  If your situation is like this, then yeah I'd have someone else maybe in the wedding party who you trust take care of this out of the room where the reception is going on.

Otherwise, I would just wait to open them until the next day, it'll be such a long night, you won't wanna do it that day anyways!  You can always invite close family & friends & bridal party members over the day you open your gifts & serve brunch or light refreshments at your home.

11549,69406,"Hi Celeste-  I am having a beach wedding, too and here are some of my thoughts.
I think that chairs are your best bet because it will hurt people's backs to be sitting on the sand like that and may not be comfortable.  Even though I am doing mine informal, I know ""dear aunt mildred"" will still wear her heels and sequence pants-suit LOL.  plus, if you had 50 people, i would say stand, its a lot cheaper, but 125 people won't all be able to see you if they are standing...
i am not doing many ceremony decorations as it might be windy and blow over, and you have the natural beauty of the ocean.  i also heard if you have a runner, it just doesn't work out well.  i am putting some roses tied to the aisle chairs with a pretty ribbon.  i thought of the whole arch idea but it was just too expensive.
i think people could carry around their own shoes... it would be the most efficient option.  
Good luck!!!
Gina"
12743,67772,"Cute theme!!  I like Mindy's ideas...however for the centerpieces, i would probably go with normal vases with flowers & puzzle pieces glued onto the vases or better yet a paper mat with puzzle pieces glued onto it then the vase sitting on top of that.  I do love the favor ideas...you could also get normal white paper boxes & just glue a blank puzzle piece in your colors on top, then on the puzzle piece get a stamp from like Michaels or something that says ""Thank You"" then fill them with ur fav candy.

Websites that may help:
www.papermart.com (for favor boxes - great prices!)
Try googling photo puzzle & mayeb you can get ur engagement picture made into a puzzle for display somewhere @ the reception."

12762,67772,"I honestly think your fiance's version sounds more like a save the date than an invite.  Invites to weddign should be more formal like your version.  I think if you want to make both of you happy then do his version in a save the Date, saying something like:

Formal Invitation to Follow

~You can send these otu as soon as you want(when you know the city/state of the ceremony location), especially to out of town guests.

Then about 6-8 weeks before the wedding send out formal invites with your wording...which is much more appropriate for a wedding invite.

12732,48751,"Some people simply don't have time (with work, school, family, etc.) to plan their own wedding, so they really need help.  If you are an organized, creative person who has the time, plan as much as you can!  I would suggest, however, having someone (a friend or to hire a professional) to keep things in line on the Big Day.  I say, ""You paid for the dress, why not enjoy it!"".  I do Day-Of Coordination starting at $325 (which I think is pretty reasonable-to have someone else doing the worrying and running around while you enjoy the day).  I have seen it for as high as $1200 for 4 hours.  But it's never too late to find someone to come in and help.  So go for it on your own, but if you get into trouble/get too stressed, I'd definitely recommend hiring someone to help you out."
12759,67772,"Since your wedding is so close, I think you should get a planner.  As far as the contract thing, yes!!!  You should definetly get something in writing...an invoice, reservation form, contract, email confirmation - something!  I would honestly not go by their word...it's too much money to just trust random strangers.  Tell them you want soemthign in writing...they shoudl be able to accommodate."
12726,67772,"I completely understand..I am scared of the same thing! We are only allowing the floer girl, ring bearer & my FH's little cousin to attend (since he would be the only one from the family not allowed & they are coming from about 4 hours away).  What we are doing is putting on the reception card the words ""Adult Reception to follow at...""  Hopefully people get the hint that kids aren't allowed, but if they do RSVP with their children, then have a family member liek your mom or dad call them & tell them that only adults are allowed at the reception and that you understand if they cannot attend if their kids cannot.

I ahve also heard of doing a little column that say ""will attend"" and will not attend"" with rows next to them & you could fill in each person's name & them check the invitees that will attend.  The only thing about this is, people might try to fill in names..they get crazy when it comes to weddings, lol. Anyways good luck & let me know what u end up doing!"

I would break the ice, I would call her and meet for breakfast or lunch, if she cares about you as much as you do and valued your longtime relationship and the love for her son, she would put all to the side and discuss all that went down with you face to face. I suggest to keep your calm and respect for eachother at all times. Keep a low tone of voice at all times, regardless of the situation. Put everything on the table whether it was true or not, be as open as you can and even talk about things that you may or may not like about eachother and how are you going to work on it and fix it. For the sake of her son and your fiance, in the end you both love in a different way the same man, and he is what counts at the moment and in order for him to have total bliss, it means that the two of you get along, you dont have to like eachother anymore as the relationship has been wounded, but you do and must respect eachother. cont.."

Regardless of the outcome, in the end you were the better person and you will, regardless of her response, in your heart, you feel so much better about yourself, It will feel like you took a load off your shoulders and be able to face everyone in an honest fashion, because you tried your best to mend the relationship and be proud of yourself and your fiance will trust me respect you so much more for that.

12759,52913,"I truly believe in a woman's intuition and not having a contract on a place where you have exchanged money is cause for an arousal of concern. Since you have already exchanged money and plan to visit next weekend, I would recommend you take a copy of the check (I hope you paid with a check, MO, or cashier's check! RIGHT?) and request a contract or some sort of wriiten agreement. You shouldn't be alarmed, but be sure to get this matter handled as soon as possible to ensure that this will be the site for your wedding. 
I hope that all works out and you find a planner to handle such issues as these. It really is a great investment!

12732,46106,"I don't think you ""need"" to at all, but it really depends on you.  I'm extremely detail-oriented and enjoyed all the research, selection, tracking, contracts, etc.  If you're not and all this stuff is making you stressed rather than excited, it might be worth it to hire a planner.  You want to keep it a happy thing.

I did hire someone for the day of coordination, though.  I don't want to have to worry about anything on the day!"
12707,27776,"Awe, congratulations, all the best to you. "

12538,80184,"Hi Sarah! Here's what I'm doing, maybe you could  do the same. Get clear glass cylinders 3"" wide by 12"" tall, (about $4 each online) and just order fresh cut stems from your grocery florist. Michaels has filled votives by the dozen. Decorate them with ribbons in your colors, put 5 or 6 on each table surrounding the flowers. Sprinkle some pretty confetti, beads, or those glass stones in between the votives. Voila!! Your tables are simply elegant! Order extra flowers for your bouquet and your BM bouquets, decorate your head table with them at the reception! They sell bouquet holders for that purpose. 

Instead of favors have a candy table. Get large clear glass canisters, cookie jars, etc. Decorate them with ribbon/tulle, fill with bulk candy to match your colors, have scoops and pretty treat bags so guests can fill their own.

I hope these ideas help. If you find any good tips, please share!! Best wishes!

Another thing to consider is some sort of puzzle as a wedding favor - if you find a company that will customize jig saw puzzles, a favor could be something sentimental like a picture of the church where you exchange vows or a landmark in your home state.  Also remember, there are different types of puzzles that you can incorporate into the day - a puzzle box being the only one that comes to mind right now.  Happy planning, Lali"
12146,15161,"Depending on your budget, white mini callas and red mini callas mixed with black bacarrat (deep burgundy with almost black edges) & white/cream color roses can make a beautiful mix. There is a deep, dark, almost black in low light calla that you can see in my portfolio. If you look there, you will see pictures of what I am referring to. I would save the actual black for accenting the bouquets, such as the ribbon wrap for the bouquets, and maybe even adding black jewel adorned stephanotis to your bridal bouquet. Should you decide to go about making the bouquets by yourself, I can ship you a kit with instructions. Good luck with your wedding planning!

It's not that big of a deal, since they're just guests and not my parents though!  My fiance invited his ex-wife's mom and step-dad.  It just seems so strange to me...

Glad to hear your folks can at least be in the same room now!  I'm glad my children are young so I have a long time before I have to be in the same room with my ex-husband for their weddings, haha!  In the end though, the kids are more important, so you do what you have to do.  Unfortunately, not all adults see it that way."

My fiance is a widow, and she they care very much for eachother and from day one she has welcomed me into his life with open arms. I dont have that akward feeling about her, I respect their relationship of over 20 years and she has become someone special to me just be being herself with me, I respect her for respecting me and who I am in his life. She is I beleive about 80 years old and she wanted to be at our wedding before it was too late for her and I welcome her as well with open arms. I guess my point is to accept it for what it is, if they are honest and like you, and enjoy seeing him happy with you, embrace it. Not too many people can say the same, thank you for your response. "
12794,26876,"I don't like either really. I had a white dress, but it had a claret red train. I like the color white, but not for a wedding dress, unless it was like mines with an accent color. Ivory, I found it to be too hard to coordinate with accessories, that was from my own experience. My cousin had a chapagne color dress, and it was very beautiful it was a little darker than ivory, with a gold feel to it, very nice and rare, I guess. "

BUT there have been so many nasty comments!  Not among each other, but to my fiancé and me.  The ones who aren't insulting other guests are calling to let us know that we're putting them in an uncomfortable position (by inviting them to our wedding!).  It's madness.  They think we need reminders that their divorces were painful (as if we have no memory of our childhoods).  It's kind of funny, though.  Right now, I'm feeling much more grown up than a lot of the ""grown ups"" in my life.  We're trying not to let it stress us out - there are many private jokes about ""cage matches"" at the reception.

In other words, on your wedding day, where do you want to wake up (your house?  your mom's house?  a hotel room?).  How are you going to get ready (have someone come to the house to do your hair?  go to a salon?).  If you can think in an organized fashion, you'll get everything done.  And, remember that it's a party; you want everyone (yourself included) to have a good time.  Try not to take it too seriously."
12794,56581,"Plain and simple, I look better in ivory... Also, I have never liked the idea of a ""traditional"" white wedding gown representing innocence, purity and virginity because I am not traditional, innocent, pure, or virginal... But I read somewhere that women in the US used to wear their best dress no matter the color and white wedding dresses were seen as a sign a wealth because it showed your family could afford a dress that you were only going to wear once...

If it is your dream wedding gown, GO FOR IT! Just be sure you look it over and take it to a reputable dry cleaners and it will be as good as new.

I remember trying it on and the entire store loved how it looked on me and so did I. My dress was a store sample with the tags still attached and was worth over $1,000. 
So go ahead and get your dress, and look beautiful on your wedding day, for less!

One thing to note, though, is that it's not the easiest to work with. It will get gloppy in a SECOND. So apply thin layers and take it slow. It also helps to have an eyelash brush handy to get the goop out. Definitely give it a trial run before your wedding day-you'll see what I mean."

Planners can certainly do all the legwork for you or simply help with coordination the day of your wedding. The most important thing to remember about planners is that we are here to help. Good planners will not increase your budget, nor try to upsell you on other vendors or rental items. You should feel very comfortable with your planner, their fees and be confident they will execute your vision while keeping within your budget. Make sure you have a written contract with your planner that states exactly what they will be doing for you and what their fees are. As far as costs, day of coordination can range from $350-$2500 and full planning usually from $3000-$10,000+. "

12759,82735,"Hi Vermont Bride! I am an event planner in Vermont and have knowledge of most properties in the state. Could you let me know what lodge you booked you wedding at? I might be able to shed some light. This time of year in Vermont, many owners head south for some much needed R&R after the ski season and before the wedding season starts. Not that is an excuse for not returning calls, that should never happen. You should have a contract, always. It is protection for you and for the owners of the lodge. Please ask for one on your visit next weekend. I  am sure they will be happy to accommodate you. And it is normal to be a bit uneasy about a place you have not seen yet, this is the most important day of your life - but remember you must have loved it and felt good when you put the deposit down.

As a wedding pro,my oldest son decieded to have his wedding on Kauai. So I planned with the bride for  a gorgeous beach wedding and a dinner at Princeville,but we gathered all present the next day and hit the beach for a festive BBQ.
We purchased inexpensive pareo/sarongs to lay on the sand and gave each guest a picnic basket with the basics,and a bottle of sparkling
Proseco wine, we grilled local fish and pineapple with simple salads of fresh fruit from a local farmers market.

It was such a hit,that people are still raving 3 years later!

Please talk to your photographer so he/she is aware of the lighting conditions, they will want to know about this in advance.

Additionally, if it is windy, candles have a hard time staying lit - if they light at all. It is a good idea to have led votive, tealight or pillar candles as a back up. They mimic the flicker of real candles and can create a beautiful atmosphere, without the worry. You can find several options for a low cost at Jamali Garden. Also, garden centers have outdoor, solar pin spots that can be used for uplighting and that can create a soft, beautiful effect as well.  Good luck and best wishes on for your wedding. "
12743,82735,"What a great theme! You can do so much with this, but remember a theme is a theme and should not overwhelm your wedding. In many cases less is more. I agree with keeping your centerpieces as flowers. But add the puzzle theme into your reception by creating little details that no one will expect. A few ideas and examples -
Cake top - Is there a cute picture of the two of you that you love. Have your baker or even you make 2 puzzle pieces out of it to use as the cake topper. 
Your table numbers can be puzzle pieces, separated just enough so people can still read them. 
For escort cards, you could create a simple puzzle (think 2 big pieces for each person) that guests needed to match to find their table. Just have someone on board to monitor this incase someone needs assistance or you need to just tell someone where to go. 
And do a signature drink with puzzle piece at the top of a swizzle stick. 
Have fun with your theme. Best wishes!"
12867,82735,"I am glad you found someone and I hope you have a wonderful wedding! Please keep posting if you need anything else. 

Best wishes."
12653,82735,"There are many ways to save on your budget that are also low maintenance and simple to do. For invites, try going with the ""green"" theme and email or phone everyone. If you want traditional invitations, take the traditional route and stop by a local stationery store or check out www.paper-source.com and pick up do it yourself invitations. Hand writing invitations is also exceptable, for something fun - let you kids help with this one! For favors, try something homemade - chocolate chip or sugar cookies are always a hit. Wrap them in color celophane from the grocery store and tie them off with raffia or ribbon. For flowers, try costco, your local grocery store and really, martha stewart. Her mail order flowers are amazing. Stick with a simple, elegant look and put the same type of flower in one vase. Best wishes!"

My boss is getting married next year and marrying someone 20 years her senior, so they don't want to have a classic wedding either (he's been married already and has adult kids).  They're looking at packages through Dreams Resorts in Mexico and Dominican Republic.  They have some really nice, affordable packages for 10 people or less, with the nice aspects of a wedding but not all the hoopla.  I think they're just switching resorts (within the Dreams hotels) for their honeymoon and getting a good package that way.   "
12816,70291,"
If I hadn't gained weight in the last year, I'd be borrowing a friend's dress that I love.  I don't think it's even an issue- do it if you can!  However, make sure you try it on (make sure it really fits!) and factor the costs of altering/fixing it.  It's a lot of money to do those things so I'd get quotes from several cleaners.  

Also, I wouldn't buy a dress online if that's where you're finding it.  I went to the bridal shop with a whole bunch of pictures of gowns that I liked and it turned out those styles (mermaid?) just looked bad on me because of my body type, so watch out for that!

Good luck!

"
12614,23892,"Well, I'm from L.A. and those are sort of our Laker colors! (Go Lakers!) I think that's a very unique and original combination. I think for a Summer wedding, I would suggest using the yellow as a more dominant color, and the dark purple as an accent color, like some floral that pops among the yellow. (I like ""pop""! I'm just imagining it as a photographer's point of view). What about different shades of purple? That's lovely, too!!

Congratulations on your engagement! Happy planning!

5216,23892,"Hi Mimi,

Are you looking for a photographer? I love the small, intimate wedding. They are truly the most memorable, in my opinion. 

If you haven't booked a photographer, check out my website and see if my photojournalistic style suits your taste. I love documenting the classic and natural moments of weddings. They are usually the pictures I can look at over and over again. Timeless.

We have packages, but also modify packages to suit each client's needs. I design all my albums with your ""story"" in mind, which makes for a unique album keepsake, which has become heirloom pieces for our clientele.

Congratulations on your engagement! Look forward to hearing from you soon!

Sincerely,
Guen

12860,15248,"Try the American Association of Wedding Officiants or the National Association of Wedding Officiants.  These are professional sites where officiates are listed and in the case of AAWO they will do their best to assist you without charging you a finding fee.  Best wishes and Congratulations on your engagement.  Rev Sandy, Maryland"
12853,15248,"Although you will save a lot of money if you elope, getting married is actually about you and the committment you make to each other. Your marriage doesn't really involve anyone except you and your fiancee so.  The wedding is sharing your happiness with your friends and family.  You don't have to go to the courthouse, you can get on a cruise ship and get married you can find a nice park and an officiate who will perform the ceremony, you go on a nice honeymoon and do the destination thing...The point, make your ceremony meaningful and enjoy the vacation!  Blessings to you both..Rev Sandy, MD"
12856,15248,"Hi, I found the below information at:  http://mr-music.com/Military.htm There is a lot more information there about invitations and other protocols unique to the military...

Actual swords are used in a Naval and Marine wedding. The arch is not mandatory, but it's definitely a memorable part of a military ceremony. On most bases, at least one chapel or an honor guard usually has sabers available for wedding ceremonies. Another possible source is the local ROTC unit. The arch is usually formed outside of the church or chapel; traditionally, a sword should never be unsheathed inside a religious sanctuary. Only commissioned officers, SNCOs and NCOs can carry sabers or swords and participate in this ceremony. 

Protocol is very important, as a former military member I know!  Blessings and congratulations and welcome to the military.

12614,83142,"I think that is a lovely fall color scheme. :)"
12794,47750,"The wedding dress i bought isn't white its called diamond white....it is a more silver tinted white so it isn't so bright. i am having an outdoor wedding in august and i felt that the sun reflecting off the white dress would be too blinding."
11527,83142,"A great book with step by step bouquet instructions is Bouquets: A Year of Flowers for the Bride.  It will answer all questions about flower care etc.

http://www.amazon.com/Bouquets-Flowers-Bride-Marsha-Heckman/dp/1556709668/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207421801&sr=8-1

Unless you are very crafty, going for that perfect round might not be such a great idea... tricky to design.  Bouquets have to be made in such a short pre-wedding time frame.  Oh yeah... you've got to GROOM all the flowers beforehand too!  Maybe you could splurge on a pro bouquet for yourself and make the rest.
A great website to buy your flowers direct is freshroses.com"
10397,83142,"I would try Etsy.com (i'm VERY biased... sorry).  There are a ton of great invite makers who are very reasonable in the Weddings category.  You can even post a custom request for what you want in your price range using Alchemy."
12813,45809,"It's your wedding... you can have them wear whatever. I told everyone in my wedding and the guest that none of them can wear a white dress (even though my entire dress will not be white). Ivory and white is okay, maybe you can add a ribbon of another color to your ivory dress and have your flower girls wear white and the color of the ribbon you choose."
12870,79479,"I suggest you cancel if they have not already recieved payment find another location.  I don't really know what you are going for a reception hall but around the area where I live Fire halls are pretty popular for weddings and most of them are pretty reasonable.  If you do your research you could probably find a reasonable caterer for you day and either do the decorations yourself or hire someone to do it for you.  It is really all on how much you want to spend and what you are really looking for.  I hope this helps, good luck and don't stress out!  "
12853,45809,"If you've been together for 16 yrs then you're pretty much already married. You could go to the city hall and get your license then have a reception afterward. There is no written rule that says you have to have a wedding. It's completely up to you. You can get a beautiful dress and your fiance can get himself a suit and you guys can go to the city hall and get married. All of your friends and family can meet you guys at the reception location and you can celebrate with them. "
12881,59886,"I like them. I also did different dresses for my BM and MOH, but all mine are different styles that the girls picked out but in the same color. I didnt want anyone to feel uncomfortable on my wedding day, so I let them pick them out but I went with them. I really like the idea of it because then they got the one that fit them the best."
12732,73502,"I say heck no!!! Have you seen them on shows I know they are helping you but they sometimes get bossy,and I can't have someone plan my special day for me. They are expensive, just get ideas off of tv or the internet, but that's just me I  can stand a bossy person. Expecially if they are attending my wedding!"
12794,73502,"Well my dress is Ivory and I like it but if you want to be totally traditional I like white. We are doing everything untraditionally I guess you would say lol but if you are doing the normal stuff white is best."
12795,73502,"I am with you! my parents are divorced and my dad got remarried and my mom has a boyfriend and they both have kids. And they do nothing but fight but I'm with you on my day everyone is going to either get along or go home. "
12870,4007,"Please check you contract  - if you don't have a contract, you really need to get one! Even if its hand written on their letterhead. Most venues are very specific in their contracts, however, a restaurant is less likely to be so. Get specific times (& whether or not that includes set up time) & EXACTLY what is included. You definately don't want surprise charges for cutting & plating the cake or for opening the chamapagne you brought (called a ""corking"" fee.) Also, it is quite common to include your gratuity in the fees, and that the fee will be more like 20% (rather than the usual 15% for a restaurant.) If they ask for a service charge in addition to the gratuity, make sure they can give you a rational explanation of what that is for. In the opinion of my regional contact for a national catering association, they are generally the same thing & you should not be charged both (without a reasonable explanation.) Hope that gives you some things to go on!"
12801,73502,"I am having alittle bit of trouble, all of the buying and matching and keeping in budget and making sure that I'm happy and all sales are final! Gosh I need a break lol, I think that we will go somewhere for awhile to get our minds of the wedding and take a relaxing mini vacation. That would be nice! lol"
12823,73502,"I feel that it is old and I am going to do it. If I don't I think I would freak out, I am a bit supersticious (spelling?) so I am dong that and my mom told me that also you have to get married on the half hour so I am doing that as well. Anything to make me feel like I'm lucky that day lol"
12711,52593,"For my wedding i wanted to use Someone Like You from the Jekyll and Hyde Broadway Show. It is sung by Linda Eder and is one of the most romantic songs ever written. We didn't end up using it because the character in the show that sings it is a prostitute. My wife had a problem with that, but I say that prostitutes can fall in love, too. LOL

You can find the song on iTunes if you want to give it a chance.

You should both sit down and list all your favorite musicians and bands and go on iTunes and look through their whole catalogs. You might not find something from those artists but you could stumble across something along the way.

Good luck."
11631,80184,"There are some oriental poppies that are red with black centers. There are also velvet red tiger lilies. Check some of the nursery websites for unusual hybrid species, order a catalog, and take it to your floral designer...that's what I did!"
12884,49136,"Hey Nicole, 

Its cute and will work nicely with your dress. My only concern is the curls at the back lasting all day. Even with the hairspray and spritz. If u will have someone to give you quick curls like before the reception then I will say go for it all the way. "
12881,52913,"Really nice dresses and I think that they will coordinate nicely together! What does the bridal party think of the dresses? I had several girls that they just didn't feel comfortable with their arms out so I got them shawls. 
Good luck on the planning!

12576,24540,"The invitation should be informative.  I think you have covered all the major items. I don't think you need a separate insert for the reception.  However, there should be a note clarifying that the reception and wedding are at the same location.  This will avoid any confusion on the part of your guests who may think information was missing from their invitation or there is no reception.   Good luck and congratulations!"

12801,24540,"The first month after my engagement, I thought I could plan my own wedding.  I bought the books, checked out websites, the whole nine yards.  And frankly found it to be overwhelming.  Between work, life and my emotional well  being I decided to hire a wedding planner.   We meet on the weekends, I review the budget, the wedding options, make decisions and sign off on contracts.  She keeps everything on schedule, on track and on budget. It is worth every cent!

I am working on small tasks but she is doing all the heavy lifting. I think you need to consider what works best for you in terms of your budget, availability, patience and know how.  This should be the happiest time of your life.  Figure out what feels right for you.  Because I work as a consultant, I can see the value in having the planners expertise and experience.  If I had the time I would do it but alas I do not.  I wish you the best whatever you decide to do."
12619,24540,"We too are paying for our wedding.  A good friend designed the save the dates and is designing the invitations.  When she started designing the save the dates she asked us about our colors, the spirit of the wedding and if we had a theme or symbol that expressed our relationship or wedding.  Based on that meeting-She selected colors, paper and beautiful accents.  She proposed 4 options and I selected 1. I think the idea of a theme or symbol tied the whole thing together for us.  We are having a destination wedding-the save the date was chocolate brown with accents of aqua blue and curry yellow.  The overlay on the ivory card was faint curry color with dots that swirl like waves.  The symbol was a star fish which represent ""infinite divine love"", which was stamped on the card in gold curry color at the base.  The font was casual aqua blue with black.  It was bound with raffia w/ blue eyelets. She did a fantastic job.  I hope this will give you some ideas of how to start!  Good luck.

"
12686,24540,"I am having a destination wedding as well.  As I have people traveling from other countries I have sent out save the dates as well as link to a website to keep them informed about the arrangements.  I agree with everyone else, in order for people to get the best prices on plane tickets, book time off etc. the more notice the better.  In fact we have several couples planning there vacation around the wedding.

Best of luck and stay calm!"
11549,24540,"I too am getting married on the beach in Costa Rica.  The acoustics is an issue on the beach and if you have a 125 people I would recommend a microphone for the officiant at a minimum.  We are having 50 guests so they will stand - no mic.  Sitting on the sand may be difficult for older people.  We are having an arch with banana leaves and palms for the aisle runner.  I am current researching flip flops to have in a basket for guests along with a bucket of water and sun screen.  We will have towels for people to wash of their feet. I am using parasols to conceal the  wedding dress.  I have not decided about the veil but think it would lovely in the wind.  For music I have a friend signing acappella. We are using seasonal orchids and flowers for the bouquet,etc.  The ceremony will be at 3:30 p.m. and we are working on the arrangements now and will have dedications to those who have passed.  We are just getting started but this is the fun part.  Good Luck"
3424,24540,"We too are having a destination wedding in Costa Rica North Pacific coast.

We going slightly off season-two weeks before peak season!  I hired an event planner not a wedding planner that is local.  The rehearsal dinner will be at a local restaurant on the beach. The resort location will be the wedding site and reception location.  The cake we are getting from a local bakery.  She is negotiating a low corkage fee so we can purchase whole sale wine.  Use market seasonal flowers.  We are using a young photographer, eager to expand her portfolio.  Hand made invitations by a friend as a gift.  
Best wishes!

Small, 75-80, family, friends, coworkers. We booked city facilities, a courtyard for the ceremony, and a hall for the reception...very affordable...so now I can splurge on the deco, flowers, catering, etc.

Go with what the two of you want, and celebrate that you found each other! Best wishes!"
12885,27776,"I like it, I also agree that the curls should be a bit more intense, but its very pretty. Love the dress, pretty.

12885,69470,"Hi Nicole,
You and your dress are absolutely gorgeous! Your hair is beautiful, but I too have to agree that the curls should be tighter if you're going to leave the back down. If I could make a suggestion...I too, am African-American and my hair is slightly shorter than yours. I would suggest going with a complete up-do. The reason I say this is because I know that the minute I start sweating or hit a little humidity, my curls are gone in an hour or less. Consider that you're going to be excited, possibly emotional, and with everything happening on your wedding day, you're going to want to look beautiful in all of your pictures all the way to the end of the reception. I think a full up-do will be just as beautiful and last much longer. :)

That's just my two cents! I wish you the best.

I personally don't really like most of the bride and groom figurines either, but my fiance and I found a cute cake with uneven layers and the bride and groom falling off of it. I thought it was a funny take on something traditional, but of course I can't find falling bride and groom figurines anywhere. 

I really like the idea of using something personal or meaningful to us at the top. For us, I'm thinking about using our RA badges from college, since that's how we met. 

This was a great discussion, thanks for all your input!!"

12901,33513,"I've seen so many pictures of bridal parties, some all the same and some slightly different but same color, fabric, length, etc. I know everyone says this, but it really depends on what you want. I personally like the idea of slightly different styles for different bridesmaids so that they can choose a style that looks best on them. I know strapless doesn't look good on everyone and some girls look great in halter top styles and so on. Just remember, nothing HAS to be a certain way. It's about what you two want/like/can afford/etc.

12902,30382,"Fall is such a great time of year for a wedding!! One of my favorites for colors!
Golds,rich creme ivories, think firey sunsets.
 I design gorgeous fall weddings , and you can use harvest tones in Olive greens to deep rich burgundies as accents too.

Go to my website link on Wedding wire to see some nice examples!
Feel free to contact me for more examples I have on other websites.

Have fun & BestWishes!!


"
12908,30382,"Of course you can!
I plan events all year for my clients and many get caught up in what they see on the BIG TV shows, Forget that! LOL

Do a theme cocktail party with your close friends,
If you arent the cocktail type , do a fun BBQ. 

At 10 year anniversaries, you can opt to renew vows or just celebrate the love with good friends!
I know of restaurants and caterers who can make some wonderful finger foods and appetizers for a small budget.

I just threw a fun Pisces cocktail party for 50 friends in March, we had small sandwiches from a great local Italian Deli,salads and finger foods and snacks with a cheese board, served Proseco sparkling wine and also had an option to make peach Bellinis with this same wine! We offered, 2 other simple cocktails and Micro brew beer. IT was a huge hit! remember to have fun with this."
12903,30382,"You dont have to designate the dress as the standout item, Give your maid of honor a different twist in the flowers or with a nice necklace.
 Much easier than trying to find a different dress style or accent.

I always suggest adding in an accent flower from your bouquet. for instance if you are doing roses and Stephanotis, and the brides maids all roses or gebera, add in a few of the Stephs to the maid of Honor and skip this addition in the maids!
Another option is a different ribbon color on the bouquet.

Hope this helps,have fun and enjoy!!
"
12901,59886,"You can do whatever you please, it is your day. What I did was went dress shopping with all my BM and my MOH and let them pick whatever dress they wanted but it had to be the same color and fabric.

Do what makes you both feel comfortable.  If it's a quick visit to city hall, then do so.  If it's a grand wedding, do it.  On any scale, it is a day you will want to remember.  A destination wedding is a great way to tie the knot.  You get to have the wedding an honeymoon at the same time.  Even if you just go to Vegas, you can have a lovely, videotaped ceremony with photographs.  At some later date, you can always throw a party and show the video to family and friends.  

The bottom line is, you and your fiance should come to a decision that works for you both.  

Congratulations and good luck!

The style of your ceremony/reception dictates the expense. The least expensive reception is the old-fashioned cake & punch/champagne reception.

My neice was getting married in Sweden and asked her sisters and her bestfriend to be in the wedding,  The sisters were overjoyed and excited to go to europe,her best friend started acting like a spoiled child and wanting control over everything, the dress, the flight etc, Turnedout she was terrified to travel, but instead of being straight about it, she made everyone miserable & caused the poor bride many hours of anxiety too.

Have it out with your bridesmaid and tell her she is causing you to rethink the bridesmiad situation,It may snap her out of it.

Good Luck and have a beautiful wedding!!"
12922,30382,"We use a sand blending ceremony that is fun and sentimental.
You can have the children each pick a color of sand and place these in a glass around a central clear vase or jar.
The ceremony would have the children pour their sand into the larger vase and then the bride and groom would pour theirs together to blend and shelter the other sand. It is a strong symbol and popular here in CA.

12933,39625,"A great idea is to do a brunch. You don't have to serve alcohol, but if you opt to do a champagne toast you could always do Mimosa's - an inexpensive alternative, an hour before the brunch is over.
Have a look and see what hotels in your town do Sunday brunch, they may be willing to hold a Private Saturday Brunch Buffet for you (you won't have to get a cake with a dessert buffet)

The brunch my family is holding is a little pricey...$50.00 per person but that's because we have food stations where crepes, eggs benedict, and other stuff will all be made in front of guests + champagne. The price started at $20.00..and worked it's way up. So if you're not picky about the intricate process, you can keep it nice, elegant, and inexpensive.

In my parents hometown the Hilton hotel does this, but the brunch isn't help in a ballroom, it's in one of the hotel dinning rooms. (They are gorgeous!)

If you did the whole registry thing the first time around many people consider it inappropriate to register again. It sounds like this probably doesn't apply to you through.

You might consider flowers in your hair or a tiera in lieu of a veil, which IS associated with a 1st marriage.  YMMV

We're making all of our favors and decorations to save money, and instead of getting a photographer, we're giving out disposable cameras so people can take lots of pictures (and of course relying on Grandpa to take the good ones).

12732,64981,"As a planner, I work with my clients and let them be the driving force as to what kind of involvement they want from me. 

A planner should not be planning your wedding. You should be planning your wedding and a planner is there to offer good counsel & support & allow you to enjoy your wedding day as a guest.

Sometimes, a planner can be as effective by meeting with a couple for a few hours for advice & offering good wedding referrals (free of commissions & kickbacks) to get a couple off in the right direction. 

Cheap should never be the guiding factor (in any of your wedding decisions). A bargain is never a bargain when it does not live up to the expectations-planner, dj, florist, etc.

When interviewing planners, check references (both clients & other professionals who they have worked with) to get a good perspective on their reputation & experience, sign a contract that outlines services. 

Most ""professional"" planners honestly do have yoru best interests at heart:)"
12385,64981,"Hi Tara, 

Destination Weddings are a great way to treat yourself, your friends and family to an incredible vacation for the very best reason. A fabulous destination & romance are the perfect combination. 

The only thing that can ruin the romance is bad planning. Yes. I am a planner and I do encourage you to consider a planner; especially someone trustworthy overseas or someone here who has a lot of experience doing weddings in your chosen destination.

Make sure you get qualified reccomendations about the planner from past clients. Choose a planner based on what is most important that they do for you.

Get referrals from past clients. Get referrals from venues & professionals. Make sure those referrals are based on their excellent performance & not because they paid to be in a special wedding guide or the venue/vendors received money. 

Having someone on the ground there (or near you who knows the destination like the back of their hand) that you trust will be worth it:)"
12711,64981,"Hi There:)

One of my favorite things as a planner is assisting people with music for their event. 

My first suggestion is to let yourself off the hook a bit and give yourself a break so you are not so stressed out & getting grey hairs. You poor thing.

You know, I have been to a lot of weddings (planned many & attended many) and I have heard ""At Last"" many times, I have heard a lot of the same songs played at weddings. And you know, no matter how many times I hear a song played, it always feels new and different and unique as the couple that are dancing to it:)

I think bridal magazines are great, but sometimes they can drive brides nuts with ""uniqueness"".sheesh!

What is in your hearts that makes you both smile or reminds you of a special moment? THAT IS WHAT makes the song unique. It is the TWO OF YOU:)

I do love iTunes as a resource for finding cool covers of classics or hidden classical gems.

Just think of all the planning and money you are spending.... do you really want her to ruin the most important day of your life.  Do you think it is fair to your future husband to have a stressed out bride?

More bridesmaids than groomsmen is common -- filling the party just to visually ""balance"" it, doesn't always make for a comfortable time.

12984,62458,"Well, you have options, but my first inclination is to say, so what!  More and more brides are realizing that it doesn't matter if your sides are even.  It's more about who the people are and what they mean to you guys collectively than just filling a spot.  

You could always mix men and women.  So just add up the attendants you have and split them equally on your side and his.  Or, if he has any women in his life who are significant to you guys, they could always stand up for him on his side. 

I had a groom who had his sister stand on his side.  

Good luck!"
12975,24939,"i would have the guest book right at the entrance of the ballroom right when the guest first come in if possible have one of the waiters greet guest at the door and remind them to sign the guest book"
11166,84296,"Hello... I hate to sound negative about this, but is it possible that he knows about this website and seen you post.  Just a thought.  If no way possible.  Than good luck, sounds like a good guy.  :)"
12732,62458,"I agree with alot of the other posts.  Whether or not you need a planner really depends on you.  Do you have time to do all of the running around, calling, etc. necessary to plan a wedding?  Are you organized enough to stay on budget, pay all vendors on time, etc.?  You really just have to take a moment to figure out what you can do on your own.  

Planners don't have to be expensive.  Many have lots of different options that you can choose from in order to make their assistance affordable to you. Options range from hourly consultation to full planning and even day-of coordination.  In my opinion, a good planner will be able to work their fee into your budget instead of their fee being above and beyond your budget.  

Good luck!"

12986,69406,"CONGRATS!!!!!  how exciting!  personally, i started by thinking of what theme i wanted.  at first i wanted a whole vineyard theme but then i decided to do it at the beach.  the first major thing i did was book my reception/ceremony spot and then everything else comes much easier.  you might want to think if you want to have your ceremony at the local church, because then you can't look at reception places too far away.  thats the biggest thing... the place you pick will suggest vendors to you after you pick your reception site. (for cake, flowers, music, etc.)  you can go from there...

11916,83995,"You're right up my alley! We're having a Halloween Costume Wedding, and I'm definitely not wearing white. 

My dress is <a href=""http://fairygothmother.com/fgm-14.htm"">this one</a>, only I'm not wearing blue, but purple and black. Our colors are Purple, Orange and Black, and my bouquet will be a clutch of Orange roses, so it all goes together. The dress ended up costing me 700 US dollars, which isn't bad, even though I had to pay expensive overseas shipping. I love the organza and I'm so excited to wear it!"
12984,73502,"I've seen that before and it doesn't look bad as long as you don't have a bunch of bridesmaids and him only have a few. Also if you have family that are men that he gets along with maybe you sould consider asking your fiance abou them."
12986,73502,"I am also a young bride so I feel you and it is stressful. You can look on www.brides.com and they have an amazing checklist of things to do. Right now you can look at different dresses but don't buy any yet, look around for where you want to get married and have the reception ( many places want you to book it early so I'd be looking very soon!!!),  think about who you want in your wedding,colors, what kinds of flowers you like. Pretty much just look around on the internet for everything. I have bought a few things because I don't wnat to get it all at once. Buy a few things here and there but make sure it's what you really want! And by time your wedding comes you'll have quit a bit of stuff."
12984,34973,"My fiance's brother had 8 groomsmen while the bride ended up (long story - involves fights and travel plan errors) with only 4 bridesmaid. We all assumed it would look terrible, but it didn't. The best man and one groomsmen stood next to the groom then two of the groomsmen brought the Mom's in then the girls walked in with the other four groomsmen. I think it might have been better if the girls walked in alone with the boys all up front, but either way it still worked. 

I've, since then, also seen two groomsmen for one bridesmaid or the reverse. 

The ones standing up next to you should be your nearest and dearest. Also another option is to have all but the maid of honor and best man sit during the ceremony. If your side is soooo much bigger, this could be a nice option. Just put them in the front row and have them ""announced"" to sit after they get up front. This I've seen before also and was still very nice. "
12986,34973,"Our wedding is now almost a year away but we begin planning in January. We started with finding the venue, then found out what options we had for the caterer. Once we found our caterer, they suggested a baker for our wedding cake (which was a good reference). Next we went looking for a DJ and booked him. Then we looked for a photographer. We're now moving onto looking for a florist and an officant to perform our garden ceremony. It all just flowed rather seamlessly after we booked the venue. 

And all the while, we were considering what we wanted for invites, favors, decor, centerpieces, bridesmaid dresses, colors and my dress. We've slowly picked up pieces as we find a good deal on what we want. I also went ahead and ordered my dress which takes 6 months to come in. Things just flow nice and calmly when you have plenty of time. "

12986,34973,"Also when you find your venue, you can figure out your date."
12947,34973,"Try: http://www.diybride.com/"
12952,46106,"When I was (almost - it turned out I couldn't go) an out of town bridesmaid, the bride selected dresses and had us give our measurements/order over the phone directly from the company.  She let us know exactly when we need to order to make sure all our dresses were from the same dye lot, thus avoiding the small color variations mentioned below."
12944,34973,"My fear about this is the B list people realizing they are List B by not getting an invite the same time as others. They can easily tell by a postage date. 

Just be careful not to make it too obvious. Also, make sure B list does NOT get Save-the-dates if you do them otherwise if you can't get around to inviting them, they'll be mad. Or opt not to do save-the-dates at all so no know knows. "
12976,46106,"I think MindyTwirl has the right idea and found some beautiful examples!  My mom is short (5'2"" or 3"") and has a big bust as well.  She has had much better luck with 2 piece outfits rather than trying for a single dress.  She ended up finding two different 2 piece outfits she loved so much she bought them both.  Good luck!"
12934,34973,"The biggest thing would be to set a budget and STICK to it. 

You can make your own favors, invites, save-the-dates, even centerpieces. Also look for things you don't need that can be cut easily. Maybe you don't care about Save-the-dates? Maybe your family doesn't need more than beer & wine and you can lessen the cost of the bar. Look for referrals for vendors who are good and professional so you don't waste money on someone you know nothing about. Ask for discounts from vendors. Ask friends and family if they want to help out. Maybe one would love the chance to be certified by the courts to perform your ceremony. Maybe another bakes the best cookies that you can give as favors with a pretty ribbon. Maybe someone else knows how to photography an event. Reuse items even - dresses, flutes, cake servers, etc. 

You can also do an off month wedding or a day other than Saturday night to save some money. Consider a Sunday wedding or a Friday wedding. "
12934,34973,"There are lots of ways, but again the biggest is to set an absolute bottom line on your budget. We even set a ""goal"" budget to shoot for which was a few thousand under which we're trying hard to stick to."
12794,34973,"Diamond white matches most people's skins, however ivory really looked much better against my skin tone. 

Try on both colors and see if it makes a difference on you. If not, just find the dress you love and see what color it comes in. "
12974,46106,"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!!  I agree with Sabra the DJ that at this point you just need to tell her she's no longer a part of your bridal party and move on.  It's going to sound bad no matter how you put it, but it's definitely necessary - especially if she is terrorizing your friends and family.  That's just crazy!
"
12697,34973,"I was always told bridal shower is thrown by the women for women. Whereas wedding shower is thrown by anyone and normally invites men and women to the event. The groom should be present if it is a wedding shower. 

Gift difference wouldn't be too much. Sometimes during a bridal shower things like lingerie and spa items for the bride are given but normally its still all off the registry so if its there, you can give it."
12958,46106,"I'm having a little bit of the same problem.  BOO!!  I've been using <a href=""http://www.biore.com/usa/products/productInfo.asp?productId=4"">Bioré Pore Unclogging Scrub</a>, and it's definitely helping.  Anything with salicylic acid is good.  The skin on my face is too sensitive, though, so I've just used it on my chest and back.  Try to stay calm (ha!  as much as possible) - have a massage or facial and keep breathing.  Good luck!"
12686,34973,"Typically you send save-the-dates 6 months in advance and then invites out 6-8 weeks in advance with an RSVP date 2-3 weeks prior to the wedding. 

Since it appears this is more along the lines of a destination wedding, the invites can and should go out earlier than 6-8 weeks. And since you are also traveling, I don't see a problem with asking for RSVPs to be earlier as well. That way you get them back before you fly to your own wedding. I'd set youself a deadline to start calling people if they have not yet RSVPed just a few days after the deadline. You got another aspect of this wedding having it be a destination one, so the earlier things are squared away, the better for you and for them. "
12680,34973,"It depends on what most people know you as. 

I think 'Natalie Marie Jones Scott' would work if the invite list is split with people who know both."
12619,34973,"If your families are involved and just can't help pay for the wedding, this is nice:
Together with their families 
BRIDE 
and 
GROOM 
invite you ...

But if the families are not at all involved, you can do this:
We invite you... 
BRIDE 
and 
GROOM 
... "
12614,34973,"Yellow and Purple are natural color friends. It'll be beautiful!"
12576,34973,"On the directions you can say something at the bottom that states the ceremony and reception are at the same location.

If it is a hotel and the ceremony is in one ballroom with the reception in another you can say something like, ""Reception will directly follow in the ______ ballroom"" 

Also, make sure the website is clear and spread the word among family and friends to help field some calls when the invites go out. "
12986,84830,"Thanks for the ideas...see we kinda did things in all different areas...like. We know where we are having it, just havnt booked a Reception area yet. We also know who's going to be in it, i'm just stuck on color ideas. Plus we already have a dj. So its very just here and there. & like one of you said you have to order your dress 6 months in advance so I need to get on that sometime soon!!"

12953,83142,"That is an awesome wedding present!  Catering is usually the most expensive part of the budget. I agree about asking the chef friend for some reccomendations."
2154,84398,"Prior to our wedding, my father-in-law walked my wife down the stairs of the B&B where we had our ceremony & reception.  The photographer and videographer were able to get great footage of seeing my ""soon to be"" wife for the first time in her gown.  It was great.  We followed that up with pictures outside...all before the ceremony.  I don't think it took away from the day at all.  In fact, it gave us more time to spend with our guests and enjoy the cocktail hour (and say a lot of Thank You's that would have traditionally occurred at each table).

Best of luck!"
12968,48751,"I have a great place I get my linens, but you have to go through a vendor, I'd be more than happy to help you.  What Linens are you looking for and how much do you have to spend?  You can e-mail me details and I can get you an estimate."

12986,48751,"I'm sure you've looked at bridal magazines, but I always suggest making a binder and actually cutting out things you like.  Make sections for your dress, bridesmaids dresses, cake, flowers, decor, hair, invitations and anything else you can find.  Over the next few months, compile ideas and then order them in the binder by your favorites.  It's fun to see what other people have done and put your own spin on it.  Good Luck and CONGRATS!!"
13005,38515,"Usually the Bridesmaids pay for their own dresses. That's all I've ever seen and done. Sometime's if the couple is well off, they could pay for the dresses, or if you are only having one or two I've heard some brides say they are gonna do it as a gift. My only suggestion is to get something that isn't too expensive. I had to pay $200 for my dress for my friends wedding and it was an ugly pink dress I will never wear again. For my wedding I'm doing all the same color (deep red) and letting my girls pick out whatever dress style they want, that way they are more likely to be able to wear it again. Good Luck!"
12604,85117,"Thanks for confirming my feelings!  I am sooooo irritable.  The man I love is bugging me so much.  And it is the little things like the way his allergies make him stiff all the time, or the way he drags his feet when he walks.  I know this is completley my issue and he is a wonderful man.  I think I am just letting my anxiety get the best of me.  You are right when you say this too shall pass, but I am contacting a marriage councelor because it has been so bad.  It's like continuous PMS!"

12595,55641,"Unfortunately I don't have any recommendations for your area, but I can tell you that I have heard many people say that the two areas to not skimp on are the rings and the photographer, because those are the things that will be around forever after the wedding.

I would find photographers in your area who have good reviews and then tell them about your budget situation. A good photographer should be able to come up with something that will work for you."
12686,70291,"Thanks everyone-  We're sending them out this week!  

"
12103,80184,"Okay seriously, all of you are way out of the etiquette line here. How in the world can you invite a single guest, who apparently is a friend or family member, and not allow them to bring a guest? That is cold and rude.

I have several friends and coworkers who are single, divorced, etc. I am inviting them with the assumption that they will bring someone with them. How could you expect someone to come to a social event such as a wedding/reception and be alone? I think some of you should think how you would feel if you were on the other side of that invite."
13015,4007,"Will your FMIL arrange your train before you go down the aisle? Will she know what happens next at the reception? I didn't think so! Here's a little blurb from my literature that answers why hire a wedding planner:""Church coordinators & the reception site coordinators only oversee the site logistics. They don't take care of the little things or anticipate emergency situations. Who will remind the best man to bring the rings? Who will make sure all of the groomsmen have their boutonnieres before the pictures? Who will know where to call if the limo is late? What will you do if the zipper rips out of your dress? On-site coordinators are often not prepared or willing to take care of these kinds of problems. As your personal assistant, your studio Gs wedding staff is experienced in seeing the big picture and smoothly bringing together all of these components.""
Bottom line - if you're paying, its your call! Breathe, be pleasant (""I'm sorry you feel that way."" (but I'm still hiring her!))"
12992,11063,"My fiance and I do not have any children together, but we both have children from our previous marriages.  We're including our children in the ceremony in some ways that wouldn't really be applicable to your situation, but we are having them stand with us, which you could also do!  I think it's great, and very sweet.  Be creative and don't feel limited to conventional ways of doing things if you don't want to.  Have fun!"
12968,4007,"If you're in the Pacific Northwest, I have some great sources for linens. Please e-mail me & let me know if I can help!"
13016,22427,"I went to a wedding with my fiance last April where the bride did this. It looked like fun and she was enjoying it and so was everyone else. So why not...haha ;)"
13016,4007,"It doesn't have to be tacky (but can be!) Choose your music wisely (no songs that mention money!) I had  client whose heritage was Polish. It was traditional in their family to have the dollar dance -in the old country they threw silver dollars at a plate until it broke, when it you you got to dance with the bride. Extra plates & silver dollars being hard to come by, it evolved into an old cigar box (passed dosn through generations) held by the MOH who collected the cash & regulated the partners.
The older gentleman in my huband's church insisted on it for my wedding (23 years ago!) even though I didn't like the idea. They were gracious & it pretty much paid for all our food on our honeymoon - great for the poor college students we were."
13005,4007,"Rachel's correct. Unless you are able to (or want to help out a bm who just can't swing it,) its up to the maid's to pay. A nice bridesmaid gift, though, is matching jewelry for all."
13016,84104,"I didn't have a dollar dance at my wedding because I felt like it was cheesy. The guests already bring such nice gifts and to ask them for money for a chance to dance with the bride and groom just seems rude. That's my opinion. :)"
13016,38515,"I agree with philschick. It is fun!! Everyone in my family does it, it's kind of a tradition. And yes, you do get to dance with everyone, say hello, everyone gives hugs and congrats. I would think if you are well off, you might not want to cause people might think it's tacky. The dollar dance was started for the bride and groom to get money for their honeymoon (and come on, who wouldn't like a little extra cash for their honeymoon?) But you just have to feel out people who will be there and most importanly, if it's something you want to do, do it! It's not like they have to give you $20 bills or anything (but some do.) Good Luck!"
12974,38515,"This is a totally crappy situation. I know you don't want hurt feelings, but you know you don't want her in the wedding right? If that's the case just tell her. You know she'll act childish and be a you-know-what about it, so just prepare your self for it. Believe me you don't want this to ruin your day. My friend had her husband's sister in the wedding even though they didn't really get along. The got in an argument just weeks before the wedding and a few days after as well. Now my friend regrets having her in the wedding cause she says when she looks at her wedding pictures, she is reminded of the arguments and is uncomfortable with the fact she was in the wedding. I hope everything works out. Good Luck!"
12958,31333,"Definitely cleanse those areas every morning and every night.  I suggest using toner at least 3 times a week.  Also try an oil control lotion so that you produce less oil during the day if that is your skin type.  And maybe try switching your foundation.  Ever since I started using the Maybelline Pure makeup with 50% more water, I've had fewer breakouts.  Clearasil works great for me but your skin type may be different.  But I definitely agree with the previous posters.  Find a way to relax and take off some of the stress.  And getting a facial could definitely help."
12256,83361,"We have made bride and groom toppers from fondant.  They can be made to hang over the cake, etc.  I've seen them used more on the groom's cake rather than the wedding cake.  Whimsical cakes are a lot of fun!  We usually sculpt the figures to have some resmeblance to the bride and groom and use the wedding colors in the tuxedo and flowers.  Enjoy your day and your planning.  Your cake planning should be a lot of fun for both of you."
12992,27776,"S&S this is an absolutely beautiful gesture of your husband, my fiance and I dont have mutual kids, but we do have children, older ones and his daughter and my two girls are my bridesmaids, my oldest is my maid of honor, she is 21..and its such a blessing that we can make them part of our day and life together. There is no etiquette anymore to follow, just follow your hearts and all will be beautiful regardless. Good luck to you both and know that you have a special man in your life for the suggestion, my fiance too is special for sugessting the same. Not many men out there that are sentimental like that. Good luck to you both and your family. "
13015,27776,"Girl, Girl, Girl, first who's paying for it? you or them? if its you, who is anyone to question what or dont you want to do on your day? Too bad for them, if they are not paying for it? Im sorry but there are boundaries when it comes to ones wedding. If they are paying for the wedding then fine, I repest the fact, but if not, Im sorry but why even discuss it with anyone other than you finance, really? Im not one to have people opinionate on something that noone other than myself or my fiance are involved in, especially money questions and/or issues. Do what you heart feels like and his, be happy and go with YOUR flow, not others, regardless, someone always has something to critize, NO? Just plan your wedding according to your dreams and enjoy your day, its coming soon, do and live with no regrets only. You've already settled for his brother why should you have to settle on your planning? pppffftttt! Good luck to you and more power to you, my two cents. I apologize if I was to outspoken"
13015,54547,"Are they paying for it? I know a wedding planner seems like an extravagence, but if you are overwhelmed and find yourself stressed out, and none of them stepped up to help you out, then you did the right thing. And if they say something about it, you say this "" I hear and understand what you are saying, but no one really offered to help me, and this is a lot of work, by hiring a planner I don't have to worry about it anymore"". Once they see what the planner has done, they will understand. Also, I really hope that his brother and his fiance have hired a planner. Destination weddings are harder than normal at home weddings. "
12823,31333,"I'm doing it.  Sometimes it's fun to do tradition.  Especially with the something old.  It's a little more special.  For mine:

Old - a pearl, teardrop neckace that belonged to my mother's grandmother
New - my wedding dress
Borrowed - probably some earrings of my mom's (I'm always stealing her jewelry anyway lol)
Blue - probably my leg garter lol

Oh, and the sixpence can be substituted with a penny.  Couldn't remember if someone had all ready mentioned that.
"

12986,31333,"I'm 19 and getting married next year as well.  So congrats lol!  I haven't really started booking anything myself, but I have started getting ideas of what I want.  I've been to a couple of bridal shops and looked at dresses and gotten ideas for what I want for bridesmaids.  Another good thing is to go ahead and work on a guest list, especially if you're maybe planning on sending out save the date cards for out of town guests.  I've gotten most of mine done.  Also good to start on that now so you can dwindle down the ones you really want to be there (and in case you have to limit it because of site restrictions).  Good luck and shoot me a message if you need any help!"
13025,31333,"You might be like me.  I never get nervous about an event until I'm right on top of it, like 5 minutes before lol.  But count your blessings that you're not nervous (yet).  That way you avoid becoming a bridezilla and can focus on the planning."

13015,70291,"Thanks everyone...the money question, well, they decided to give us some cash for the wedding last weekend, waaaay after we had already chosen our location based on having (no) money.  We picked a place that was okay with credit, but there were several others I would have really liked had I known that we would be receiving cash from somewhere. (My family doesn't have any money, and I'm a high school teacher) I'm a little annoyed because we announced our engagement the second week of February and that same week his brother took the date we really wanted in October(my fiance is a teacher too and we both have a 4-day weekend that week, but no other 'free days' in the fall).  His parents are now asking us if we can re-do what we've already done in terms of planning, don't like our location, etc.  
I'm sure it will be a lovely day but I'm somewhat bothered by these games, and now the wedding planning critiques. I think it would be different if they had offered us the money upfront."

Old: a small white bible that pretty much every woman in my family has had with her on her wedding day

New: My dress, veil, shoes, etc...im sure everything is pretty much new

Borrowed: Not sure yet. I told my mom to buy a huge diamond necklace so i can borrow it hehe

Blue: im thinking of getting diamond drop earrings with some small sapphires in it. It will be something blue and a keepsake :)"

12597,17259,"Here are some tips to reduce the amount of paper, envelopes and postage for your invitations:

1)As mentioned before use a response postcard in lieu of the card and envelope. Be sure to put your mailing address and a stamp on each card.
2) Choose an invitation with a pocket to hold your response cards and extra inserts which eliminates the need for the extra inner envelope to keep everything together.
3) For the individual guest addressing (Paul, Jane, and Sarah)you can use a belly band - cut a 1-1.5 inch wide strip of paper that matches your stationery and wrap it around the outside of your invitation. Address the belly band by hand with a pretty metallic or gel pen (you could also print the names on the paper and then cut it out). Glue Dots work great to close the belly band. 
4)Or you can take a small paper square/circle/scrapbooking tag that is hole punched and tied around the invitation with ribbon, twine, or cord. Hand address them with a pretty pen as well.
Hope that helps"

Don't stress out, we are here to help!  Congratulations! "
13016,83142,"It sounds like fun.  You may want to gauge it by the formality of your wedding and the crowd you anticipate, but I doubt people would see it as a grab for money."
12953,50366,"I agree, that is a wonderful present.  I would suggest having something that you would be able to put out a buffet.  Even though your friend is cooking you will still need to have friends or relatives (or hire) help set-up the buffet.  So keep that in mind.  If you have a ""sit down"" served dinner you would need to hire help, so a buffet would be a good option.

You can have a buffet dinner with any specialty main course that the chef makes.  And of course pasta with a meat and vegeterian sauce would be economical and filling, and I'm sure you guests would enjoy that with a nice salad, bread and veggies.  I would also have some kind of a cheese tray and vegetable tray when your guests first get there to munch on, especially if you are going to have any alcohol - don't want them to get too loopy, too fast!!!

13043,7559,"Yes you are correct you will need a bit of extra time to plan a destination wedding. There are many different ways to plan a destination wedding now days just about anything goes. When you send and expect and RSVP is really up to you and your planning needs. If the Site and vendors in France need their numbers by a certain date then you will have to get info to and from the guests in time to do so. If you have guests up in the air about attending because of the price factor you might want to use a Destination Wedding Specialst that also offers Travel services. They would be able to put together group prices so it might be easier for your family and friends to attend. Hope this helps...

13015,7559,"I just had a discussion with two Brides this last week on what was allowed and what was not. So I will tell you what I told them 1. Who is paying for the wedding? The Couple, Brides parents, or Grooms parents. 2. Who is getting married the Couple, Brides parents, or Grooms parents? LOL I know dumb question....Then I told them this...You can be tackful with either set of parents and explain that it is not them getting married but you. Therefore, if YOU want to have a wedding planner, black flowers, pizza reception then go for it and if people do not like it they can go home. This is YOUR DAY and you want it to be without more stress then you already have. Also, how do they know what a planner cost's...with my company each Brides price is different depending on what they need....So if YOU want a planner then you hire one."

I joined a church in Atlanta that required 8 weeks of classes or a super Saturday.  Many churches are a lot more laid back, but this doesn't sound like one of them.  Try talking to a clergy member and see what they say.  You might find them friendly and open to the idea.  Pre-marital counseling can't hurt if they ask for that."

13048,85622,"Take the time and pray before you join any church. Remember God is going to look at your motives and if you are joining a church just to be married in the building its for the wrong motivation. Explore the teachings of the church and what is required. It could be a great ministry for you and your fiancée to join. It is also important for you to join a church since you are not attending one and you are Christian. FYI marriage counseling is a must. You will need a home to build you and your husband when you do tie the knot. If it is still too exhausting finding a location and you dont have to marry in a church look at alternate locations such as beaches, parks, or non religious buildings. Church is traditional God will still honor your marriage outside of the four walls. 

God Bless!! Keep us posted"
13048,48751,"There are plenty of beautiful churches that will let non-members get married in their sanctuary.  You will most likely have to pay a fee, but I dont think it's worth joining simply to use the building.  Try eventective.com or even a google search for churches in your area and start making calls.  My hisband and I didn't have a church we were ""attached"" to, so we looked around, but ended up getting married at my parent's farm.  It was still a very Christ-Centered Ceremony (we were definitely in a beautiful part of His Creation)so maybe look into options other than a church."

Yellow can bring out the yellow tones in lighter skin and wash people out, but can do wonders for darker skin.

12999,56581,"I've been to showers a couple months before as well as a couple weeks before the wedding. For the most part, I think you should think about who you are planning on inviting and what would be convenient for a fair majority of your guests, although out-of-town guests do not usually attend the shower. If your shower is the traditional ladies-only event, also keep in mind that you do not have to invite all of your female family and friends. Lastly, the bride doesn't host the shower, so when it is held, although your input is highly valuable, is one of the things where you are not necessarily running the show. Good luck!"

13016,56581,"I don't think it's tacky, as long as you are not trying to ""sell"" yourself or spouse to the highest bidder, have money-related music, or drag it out to get more money. Also think about how you are going to go about collecting the money. You can have a ""collection agent"" like someone in the bridal party taking money, putting it a secure location, and managing dance partners, and I've even seen it done by pinning or clipping money to the happy couple. Just do something that fits you, your new spouse, and your crowd... When my mom married my step-dad when I was 8 years old, the money dance was one of the fondest memories I have from her wedding."

I would look great in any shade of yellow because I have a warm skin tone, but my best friend who has fair skin would look pale and washed out in a light yellow but could pull off a brighter yellow... You may find a dress color the you absolutely love but just doesn't compliment a BM. In this case, even if you are happy with the color of the dress itself, if it doesn't look good on your BMs, you will be stuck with less than spectacular photos... "
13049,56581,"Go for the after party if you want to let loose with friends and family!!! People that like to party will find a way to entertain themselves whether you host something or not...

I was an out of town bridesmaid, and it worked out great.  We went through David's Bridal, so I was able to try on the dress and everything, and then just ordered it from the shop in her hometown.  That way it went through the same dye-lot as the others.  We all had different styles b/c we are all built differently, and that also looked awesome.

13046,46106,"I think it's a great idea to go shopping with them so you can see how good or bad it really is.  

Another thing I noticed is that the <a href=""http://davidsbridal.com/bridesmaids_return_by_color.jsp?cfid=41"">David's Bridal</a> website uses lots of different models.  You can sort of get a feel for what different skintones look like in different colors.  In my opinion, the blonde girl doesn't look so hot in the Canary colored dress, but again, you can gauge the degree of bad or good when you consider your whole bridal party."

You could go shopping, pick a couple of different shades of yellow to narrow it down. Then have them go with you to check it out. Yellow is a touchy color....it plays funny color games with complexions and haircolors...."
12947,80184,"DIY is soooo much more personal. The industry wants us to believe that we're not capable of handling some of this ourselves, and that we're stuck with their 300% markups.

Remember, everything that's labled ""wedding"" is soooo blown out of proportion.

I booked my own venue, which includes tables & chairs, and a full kitchen.  I'm doing my own invitations, favors, florals, centerpieces, ALL of my reception decor.

I'm wearing dangly green stoned earrings set in a antiqued gold color setting (it's all costume jewelry, this is just the best description I can muster!), and a simple matching necklace.  The necklace is a pendant with little danglies on it like the earrings, and it's on a chain the same colored gold as the rest of the pieces.  It's very antique looking, and I chose the green because the trim at the top of my dress is green so it matches well.

12239,17259,"Use a circle craft punch (or punches in various sizes) and create paper circles in your colors and scatter them on your tables around your centerpieces. Kind of the same ideas as with flower petals or confetti, but they would be polka dots instead. Just rent some table cloths and scatter them around the table. No need to buy or rent expensive polka dot table cloths or overlays.

Also you could easily take vases, candle holders, or pots and paint dots on them with a cotton ball, pencil eraser or stamp in your wedding colors. Walmart always has a lot of plain clear glass vases, bowls, giant wine and margarita glasses etc. near their craft and floral department for real cheap. You could put flowers, grass, favors, candy, nuts, food of any kind in all sorts of glass containers that are painted with dots. Ooo, you could even paint your champagne glasses with dots, how cute!

I will repost if I think of anything else.
I can think of a million ideas for polka dot invites & stationery."
13102,17259,"That is such a pretty color combination. I love it! I would say brown or turquoise shoes would look best. If you cannot find any that match those black would be a good alternative since the dress is dark in color. A shimmery light bronze or gold might look nice too.

Best of luck,
Jaime"
13086,17259,"Sounds like you have a flaky vendor on your hands. My professional opinion: They should respond to you within 24 hours by email or phone unless they have let you know (on an outgoing voicemail or automated email message) that they will be out of the office or getting back to customers within a certain amount of time.

Also make sure they are recieving your emials in the first place. I have had some email communication troubles (they never recieved emails) before with my clients. I've learned that you cannot always count on email and I always follow up by phone if I think a client should have gotten back to me within a certain amount of time.

If you have not yet signed a contract or paid a non-refundable deposit you may want to find another venue, just to be on the safe side. You want your day to be perfect and they may not be able to follow through on their end. It isn't like you don't already have enough to worry about?
Best of luck to you,
Jaime"
13016,41195,"This is a fun activity for everyone. It is traditional in some cultures. If the money is making you feel uncomfortable try a ""special blessings dance"" thats where all the guests write a special blessing on a small piece of paper and give it to the maid of honor in place of the money. you and your new spouse can read them later. Just one of many options!
Please feel free to email me with any entertainment questions"
13057,26876,"its probably possible with that many guests, I'd maybe consider looking into restuarants in the area rather than hotels. Lightfoot in Leesburg, VA is a very nice place always has events there. Have you considered maybe doing it in your own home, or someone elses? That can potentially save you money as well. "
13102,27776,"This dress is very pretty, however you are having a summer wedding, so I would go with either turquoise shoes (dyeable ones) or a gold tone to bring the summer color out. Good luck!"
13086,27776,"Oh my, for me that would be a BIG, VERY BIG FLAG, I would stop calling and emailing them and personally drive out there and try to speak with someone, if you havent already given them a deposit, I would for sure search for another hall, Obviously their lack of response and/or contact, is very unprofessional and this would be a concern for me on my wedding day. Actions speack volume and you dont want to risk having a disaster on your special day. No, NO, go find another hall. Good Luck, sweetie. "
13049,27776,"Cheap is a good thing. Why isnt there alchol involved? Because they dont provide it? or they dont allow it? if they allow it, arrange for a company to come in and service it for you. if not then I would also do the after party, however you will probably be exhaused from the first party, so keep that in mind. Good luck. "
13025,61966,"My wedding is just a month away and I'm not really nervous at all. But lucky (or unlucky?) for me, I've got so many other things to worry about (graduation from college, commissioning in the Navy) that the wedding is the one truly organized thing :) I'm really excited and can't wait; the one thing that worries me is wrapping up all the loose ends before the wedding, but I'm sure it will all be taken care of. Congrats and good luck with your wedding! "

To find a string quartet, try looking on wedding sites and searching on line.  I also want to restate what a previous writer said about finding musicians who play weddings.  It is important that the musicians have experience playing for weddings."

And my hair pieces are gorgeous pins from Toni Federici.
Since my dress has tons and tons of beading I wanted to stick with simple and elegant."
12975,8044,"Something I always do at my weddings, in addition to having the guestbook setting out when guests arrive, is to be sure that everyone has the opportunity to sign the guest book by passing it around each table.  You can have whomever is in charge of the guest book do this or your wedding coordinator.  Generally I do this as people are finishing up dinner, just before the cake is cut.  "
13048,41961,"As a Wedding Planner and a very involved member of my own church I would advise you to keep searching. Church membership is a serious commitment just like getting married, it should be done for the right reasons. There are many churches that allow non-member weddings and even if you cannot find one non-religious venues can be just as memorable and still have a Christian and Godly feel to them. My husband and I were married at a historic home because his family is Baptist and mine is Episcopalian. We still had a Christian service complete with a small sermon from our minister, and hymns sung by a vocalist friend. Whatever decision you make just make sure you will be completely happy with it when you look back in years to come. Good Luck, and Congratulations."
13005,41961,"It is up to the Bridesmaids to pay for the dress, but often when it comes to couples whose friends are still in school other arrangements can be made. If it is in the wedding budget the cost can be split between the bridesmaids and the couple. If the budget is limited you can help in other ways. Allow the bridesmaids to purchase their own dress of the specified color, this way they may like the dress enough to wear it again. Find a dress at a department store, many department stores will help you find the right sizes at stores in other towns or order the right sizes for you. There are also many boutiques that rent bridesmaid dresses for much more reasonable prices. Keep your eyes open and be a smart shopper and you can make the whole experience much more pleasant for you and your bridesmaids."
12975,41961,"I have found that having the guestbook on a specified table at the entrance is the best place. Also, it is good to have Not Just One but TWO attendants nearby because inevitably while a few people are gathered around to sign others will come in and never even see the guestbook. So have one person directing people at the door towards the guestbook and another actually at the guestbook table in case of a question or a pen malfunction. It is also a good idea to have someone to remind everyone to sign the guestbook right before the cake cutting. I say right before because it is common for everyone to instantly start talking or heading to the cake table right after the couple cuts the cake and they don't pay much attention to anything that is announced.

13080,46106,"Your jewelry sounds amazing!  I think whether you should do the necklace or not depends a lot on you.  Do you typically like to wear a lot of jewelry?  My daily stuff is my engagement ring (of course!), stud earrings and a tiny wrist watch, so I felt like a necklace was too much for me.  Even though it probably would have been ok with my dress, it just didn't feel right.

My dress is strapless and covered with teeny tiny pearls.  My hair will be like <a href=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y116/kaycerenee/weddinghair.jpg"">this</a>, except I have dark chocolate brown hair and the flowers will be pearled stephanotis.  As I mentioned, I'm not wearing a necklace, and <a href=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y116/kaycerenee/IMG_1060.jpg"">these</a> are my earrings (please ignore the fact that my ears get bright red when I touch them and I didn't wait for them to cool down for the picture hehe).  My mom may or may not be making me a tiny pearl and crystal bracelet, depending on her time."
12933,85834,"Jessica,
One of the most important aspects of your wedding will be finding a great photographer.  Photographic Expressions offers a variety of packages for every budget.  You can be assured your photographs will capture the elegance of special day.

We invite you to take a look at our website and give us call to discuss specific details."
13033,11063,"Ok, I had never heard of it until I read your post.  So my fiance and I looked it up on iTunes last night and bought one episode just to see.  Oh my gosh, it was horrific and hilarious at the same time!!  They're showing a bunch of them on CMT this Saturday...hahaha!"
12816,85834,"If you like the gown, I say go for it! Don't be nervous.  It is a blessing that you would find a beautiful yet inexpensive gown to wear on your special day.

12532,85834,"Congratulations!  

The best place to begin is at the post chapel.  They will provide you with many specifics you will need to know.  I am also pretty sure you will have a cordinator to consult.

I believe one of the respondants mentioned how important a great photographer will be.  We agree and would like to invite you to take a look at Photographic Expressions.  "
13080,27776,"Kay, I love it all what you have choosen, I think that your earrings are long, so a necklace may not go with the theme, but put one on do a try out, you never know, my earrings are not as long but they are rhinestone, I guess I dont all that bling bling. I too wear my daily jewerely which consists of my ring as well, LOL, my watch, hoop earring, not big one and my journey of love diamond pendant that my Finacee gave me as a gift,I love white gold, so all of is is white gold. 

thanks for the compliement, I havent had time to post pics. "

I would take everything that you just wrote to us in your post and write it to your fiance's mother in a letter on nice stationery and mail it to her. 

Something like this:

Dear [finace's mother's name],

[finance's name] and I have been dating for over five years now, and I am totally ready to be with him forever more. You and I were so close and had a strong bond! A rumor got started two or three years ago that was totally false! And we haven't talked since!

I miss you! I don't know what to do about it. But I am in love with your son so deep and I really want you to help me pick out my wedding dress! plan the wedding, have brunch the day before, and just be here for me as I know you would have had this rumor not been started!

I love you and miss you,

13139,85604,"$1500 to $2000 for three bouquets at $100 each. $100 for the mens flowers, $100 for each table, $500 to the florist??? I would go with roses and calla lillies as I get a wholesale price for Organic's. I could work up an actual quote. Depending on your details and vases the price could go lower or higher. What kind of flowers  would you like and what kind of arrangements do you want for the center pieces?
My other company is Organic Weddings. "
13138,85604,"White veil is fine. Enjoy!!! and Have fun!!!"
13112,83142,"You can try having one made for you.  Try Etsy.com"
13139,39625,"Ok, Oragnic's price quotes are quite high, and I'm guessing is quoting a price for organic flowers.
Something you don't need, unless you expect your guests to eat the centerpieces.
The best thing to do is to meet with a florist, tell him/her what you would like to spend on table centerpieces. Now depending on whether you want tall or short centerpieces the price can vary from $30.00 to hundreds. You can always ask them  to arrange a few centerpieces with flowers you want in different sizes/shapes/price. You're bridesmaids bouquets should be about $100 for both You can always give a capstone on how much you want to spend on bouquets and other items. Grooms mens boutonnières are about $25.00 each.  
Decide on flowers first because that's what's going to affect your price range. Roses will be inexpensive; calla lilies and orchids will be expensive, but gorgeous.
Good Luck!

that's really a cool idea. although the letter thing just seems so much more shy and kind of kiddish (for MY personality that is). and even though sometimes writing letters is good, this is an issue that is way bigger than a ""simple"" letter, i should talk face to face with her. i have discussed it with my fiance and when he comes back fromout of town we are going to both speak with her....i think it would be just a little comforting to have him present. but your advice was great, i actually didnt know that my words pack so much punch until i just reread it in your form!!!

13080,56581,"I usually wear big, dangly earrings everyday, so I thought I would go with something like that for my wedding as well without a necklace, but I discovered that it wasn't as flattering with my dress as I thought. As it turns out, I will be wearing small, simple diamond-shaped rhinestone drop earrings and a necklace with a matching drop in the center with a round glass bead and rice-shaped pearl chain. The necklace really compliments the off-the-shoulder neckline of my dress, which is lined with pearls and beads. The earrings and drop portion of the necklace are cheap costume jewelry that I got at Claire's for my best friend's wedding. I created the glass bead and pearl strand myself from a necklace of pearls that I got from my grandmother and beads I bought at a bead store... I'll try to post pictures later... "
13109,56581,"Look at it this way, the money that you are saving on getting an affordable hall and NOT paying for alcohol at the reception, you can put to good use elsewhere.

13181,43335,"Hi TCA,

You do have a few option depending on your budget... I am planning our wedding on my own but it is going to be local. Since you have so many distance concerns and probably time constraints as this is your first job maybe you guys should look into finding a wedding planner. This way they can take care of all the added stress. If you find one in TX then they know the areas and have good connections with vendors. It's worth a shot to look into it. 

Best of luck!

13108,67772,"Actually that's really low for a wedding in NOVA.  The only thing I can think of is maybe getting married at a church where your a member that should be free, then maybe doing a fire hall for the reception.  Even then, $5K is really low cuz u would have to get catering & rentals.  Maybe u shoudl try having the reception in a private room in a nice restaurant.  You will have to find one large enough for 50, but that would prolly be the nicest, most affordable option.  "

The one I originally wanted had a members only rule as well, but we found a really nice church & even selected a pastor from another church that we felt comfortable with.  U end up paying higher fees than you would if you were a member but I think we made the right decision int he end.  Joining a church should have more reasons behind it than just wanting to get married there.  Plus what if u join & find that ur date is already booked - little chance, but hey it could happen!"
13154,46106,"I had lasik, so I don't have to worry anymore.  It is something I had thought about before I decided to have surgery.  I never came to a final decision, but here are my thoughts:

I think a lot of people wear contacts or go without glasses for the ceremony.  I personally would NEVER agree to not be able to see during my wedding ceremony!  That sounds awful.  I'm torn on the contacts vs. glasses issue, though.  I guess to me if you wear glasses sometimes and contacts sometimes, I'd rather go with the contacts.  But if you wear glasses all the time...  It just seems kind of weird to me to get contacts just for the day because you end up not looking like <i>you</i>.  And you, after all, is the person he wants to marry.

13181,46106,"I'm not normally a jump straight to ""you need a planner!"" person, but honestly with all you've got going, I'd say that for the sake of your sanity and things not falling through the cracks, you need a wedding planner."
13181,87015,"You could also take a couple trips to Texas in the meantime and begin looking around. I have great contacts in Texas if you need any help shoot me an email. I don't know if its ok to mention names on here. At least you will probably have good weather.  If it was me I'd run off to japan to have the wedding. It'd be lots more exotic! ha ha"

13102,83142,"Hmmm... I vote for bronze. Check out the Manolo's in today's (Friday's) post on The Bride's Cafe (I LOVE Janie Medley!).

Not that I would wish that heel height (or price tag!) on your maids, but I can totally picture it.

13187,72559,"The brides I've worked with that take more time off before are usually DIY brides who are doing things like their own flowers, making favors, etc. My clients who are working with a coordinator, or working with a hotel that takes care of a lot of the details often don't take that extra time. It sounds like you have everything under control, I wouldn't worry! "
13102,78470,"Ahh, those Manolos would be so perfect!  But you're right... if I made my bridesmaids wear 3 1/2 inch heels I'm pretty sure they'd resign! (Never mind the price tag!!)  The only way I could get away with that is if my ceremony and reception lasted a total of 30 minutes- ha!  I emailed my girls the link to all the bronze shoes on bellisimabridalshoes.com and so far the response is good!  Thanks for the suggestions ladies!!"
13187,27776,"Oh, Im definetely taking a few days off before my day, I will use that time to finalize certain, things, like rehearsal, rehearsal dinner, welcome out of state guests, my nails, pedicure, dressing up ,my home for the wedding, i.e flowers, decor, dressing room, bringing to the reception all my favors, seating cards, cameras, etc... so many last minute details and I want to be well rested for my bid day, stress free from work, LOL.... in any event Kaycerenee, all the best to you and your fiancee...I realized that your wedding date is actually the day of my bridal shower. Good luck. "
13187,43575,"Honestly its up to you. If you feel comfortable working up to the last day its up to you. I would like the couple days before the wedding off because I have family coming into town, finalizing plans and what not. Also it gives me a moment to breathe and one less thing to worry about...work."
13102,43575,"my vote is for choc. brown or a deep rich brown shoe. If you use silver shoes i recommend having them wear a white gold or silver jewelry to tie it all in."
13086,43575,"I called their office number 2 times in 2 days and no pick up. I even went there in person and no one showed up. I even called again to make sure what time they are suppose to open their doors for ""tours"". On their voice mail it saids that they would be open at noon. I waited an hour and no one came in. I was pretty ticked. When I got home I looked through some old emails and I found the WC personal cell phone. I gave it a call and the WC picked up. According to her she never recieved any of my emails.... I resent the 1st email at least 3 times and the 2nd email 2 times.... She said to resend the emails and she will answer it by tonight. Its 10pm now and still no answer....."

13016,25530,"For the longest time, my answer to this would be tacky. However, a wedding last year changed my thoughts on this altogether. 

If you're going to do it, don't play stripper music and bump and grind. Play it to song that's romantic and sentimental. Trust me, your family will thank you for it. "
13187,56581,"If you can't think of anything to do if you take some time off, then maybe it's not for you. When my supervisor took the week off before her wedding, she kept calling the office because she was bored, annoyed with family, and even wanted to check in on work.

13200,85169,"Jessica - Your save the date card looks really cool! It shows personality and I am assuming you are planning a beach themed wedding. 

Second, send out your save the date cards as soon as you know the date (which you do) and your invitation list is done. Although you may still send out a few more if parents or the two of you want to add (although you should try to limit adding for planning purposes).

I hope this helps!

13192,85169,"This is always difficult - especially when mom is footing the bill - but it's time to sit down (try picking a time when she's in a good mood) and explain (in a calm voice) that you really appreciate all her help, and you want her to be part of the process, but you also want to make sure that your vision for your wedding happens. Explain the items/ideas that you have for the event, and really try to get her excited about your ideas.

Also come up with a list of things that you (reasonably) have to have and discuss those with her. You may find there are things that you don't really care about (or that she really does care about), and ask her to take care of those things.

Just try to keep the lines of communication open.

I hope this helps!

11642,85834,"Hi Melissa,
Congratulations on your engagement!

A love that you are a creative individual.  It sounds like you're planning a spectacular wedding.  Photographic Expressions takes painstaking efforts to document every detail of a wedding.  I would love the opportunity to show you all we have to offer. "
13197,11188,"The time of your wedding is up to you. If the priest is available for that time you should be able to be married at 5PM. It will depend on if they are having service or some kind of event that day. I would make some calls."
13109,11188,"If not having liquor won't be a problem for you it should not be a problem for your guests. If it is a problemfor you, then I suggest looking elswhere. If you have provided a down payment I would do something like a Non-alcoholic bar, Virgin dauqaries, Virgin Mohito's, specialty drinks, non-alcoholic beer. It would be a fun thing."
12732,11188,"Your need for a wedding planner is totally up to you and the time you have to dedicate to your wedding. Wedding planners are not here to seperate their clients from more of their money. We try to save you money. 

Your budget is the most imnportant thing and ourjob is to keep you within that budget or lower."

13181,24540,"I live in the US and my FH lives in Canada and we are getting married in Costa Rica.  So I can sympathize with your situation.  One month after the engagement, I was back in the States and was completely overwhelmed with planning a wedding and work.  So, I did nothing for another month.  After getting tired of everyone asking me how the wedding plans were coming along,  I did the best thing for my sanity - I hired a wedding planner.   She lives in the sam city as I do but also works in Costa Rica.  A weight has been lifted.  So my recommendation would be to hire a planner and check out http://www.stylemepretty.com/ for inspiration.  Best of Luck!"

13043,24540,"I am having a destination wedding and have sent out the save the dates 9 months in advance and will be sending the invitations out 6 months in advance.  The save the dates allow people to book the time off and save for the wedding (especially if it is a desitnation wedding).  I have hired a wedding planner that speaks the language and is familiar with local vendors, laws and contracts.  A planner can also assist in negotiating with rates with local vendors, shipping, assisting with travel arrangements for guests etc.  Best of luck!"
13200,56581,"Like you, I will have a number of out of town guests and have more than a year before my wedding. I am planning on sending out my save the dates about 9 months in advance (January 2009 for a September 2009 wedding). I love your save the dates, but sending them more than a year in advance seems a little too far to me. Most airlines don't make reservations more than a year in advance, so  your guests will not be able to make arrangements for at least a couple of months. Any time after the one-year-to-go mark should be fine."
13214,56581,"My personal favorite is the first one... If you really can't make up your mind, ask the flowergirl which one she likes or choose the one that best matches your bridesmaid's dresses or your dress."
13154,19057,"Don't change who you are.  You are you and when you look at pictures later you will realize that you don't look right without your glasses.  I had one picture taken without my glasses and it looks funny to me.  I am glad both my husband and I left them on."

Congratulations and good luck!"
12885,24540,"You have very lovely hair and it looks great down.  However, if it is hot your curls may drop.  Perhaps wearing it up may get you throught the ceremony, photograpy and reception.  But it does look fabulous down as well."
13187,24540,"We are having a destination wedding. Most of our guests are arriving the day before the wedding - Fri.  The planner, myself and the groom are arriving 3 days before the wedding- Wed.  The MOH, BM and some family are arriving 2 days before the wedding.  The extra day will give my FH and myself some time to relax together - sit on the beach and kick back - before the excitement begins.  I say if you can afford the time off, you should take it!  So you can be relaxed on your special day.  Everyone will be arriving at the same time to see you and your FH and will want to spend time with you.  If you don't have a buffer between you and your guests you may want a little down time before the events begin.  Congratulations and enjoy!"
13139,86217,"I am paying 75 dollars for 100 roses on samsclub.com the also have diff. flowers in bulk if you dont mind making you own bouquet and flower arrangements Me and my brides maids r making our own bouquets and fllower arrangements. "

12992,68369,"Hi there.  I had kiddos from a previous marriage, and we included them in a candle ceremony.  I got candles online that say "" a circle of love makes us one"".. and it has all of our names and the date.  We all had smaller candles and lit it together (all 4 of us)  it was really nice, and we have the candle in our home as a reminder."
13016,8287,"Hello Meryl, I would like to address your statement.  ""...to get a dance in with everyone.""  Because it is your day I don't think that will be a problem.  You can even go up to guests and bring them to the dance floor and dance with them.  Who is going to tell the bride, NO!  Have your DJ make an announcement and make it creative with regard to how many guests can keep the groom from finding/dancing with his bride and watch people try to dance with you to keep you two away from each other but at them same time you are getting to dance with everyone.  

When something is cultural there is no need for explanation, people will do it with no prodding but it may back fire on you if you do the money dance and it has nothing do with your cultural or the culture of those that are in attendance."
13209,39625,"Depending on the type of dress you want, you could find it on eBay, Jcrew or
Nordstrom. http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/6014155/0~2376776~2374327~2374331~6014155
Nordstrom has awesome bridal dresses that you can surely find in your size and price range!
If you can't find anything I actually suggest you call a bridal salon and let them know your budget to see if they can accommodate you.
Good Luck!"
13173,48751,"Directions to ceremony/Reception and other necessary locations, maybe a list of a few local restaurants and activities.  It's also nice to put something in a gift basket that is from the area, like a bottle of wine from a local vineyard, homemade preserves from a local farm, or even fruit.  Some type of ""useful"" souvenir that is special to where you are getting married.  It will be a nice treat, especially for people who have never been to that area before.  Other than that, It sounds like you have a pretty good start.  Congrats and good luck with your wedding!"
13057,87455,"You should look into having it at a restaurant. I think that would be cheaper because you won't have to worry about renting linens, extra chairs, dinnerware, and catering. As for DW it can be expensive depending where you want to have it and the time of the year. 

Check into wedding packages...I know in Cancun has free wedding packages if you stay there longer, upgrade your room, or have at least have some guests staying in a standard room for 4 days. I was looking into Dreams Resorts and they have good packages. Its great for families with kids too. You may want to check what the marriage requirement are wherever you go. Some places require a shorter or longer stay. Definitely go with a Travel agency because they may be able to help you get a discount. Unfortunately, I can't have a DW because non of my guests can't afford it. Hope this helps and good luck!"
13214,87455,"I like the 2nd to the last one (with the dark red ribbon)Good luck!"
13220,85169,"Although I have not personally worked with them, I have heard good things. It can't help to look and see what their prices are, but just go into the meeting knowing what you are willing to pay, and that Martin's may not be in your budget.

Enjoy! "
13215,1616,"I agree. Give him the title of ""Jr Usher"" and let him play host. He can also make sure your guests sign the guest book."
13222,87586,"I would say check your local parks for locations that allow weddings/receptions.  I know someone who got married in a beautiful state park and only had to pay $25.   "
13222,70212,"Hi local parks is a good idea, you can have a picnic or bbq and bring boom boxes with CDs for music. 

Also ask a relative for their home. 

Also start calling restaurant/bar types of places that will not charge you for the room but will give you the place for your large party and can do a buffet. 

If you do it on a night where they already have a band coming in to play that you like then they will be your band. Or call places that have a jukebox and try to get in the deal that you can have the jukebox free for the night. 

Ask a relative or friend to get licensed to perform marriage ceremonies and have them marry you instead of paying a priest to do it. 

Check out restaurants that have all-you-can-eat buffets and reserve for your large party and perhaps get a group rate. Then go out to a bar or some place that a band is already playing or that has a jukebox to continue celebrating. (Like at the end of the movie ""Sweet Home Alabama"")

13165,87455,"Hi there! I know how you feel. Neither of our families don't seem to be wanting to help out. Ive told them that we are planning a wedding for June 2009 and you would've thought they would jump at the chance to offer to help with the planning. We are pretty much paying for it. My divorced parents can only give a small amount of money. Also, one of my aunts is going to give us whatever money she can. Its not much but it does help. Maybe you can ask one of your relatives if they can help with paying for the cake and some of the food. Its frusterating when you can't get the help you need. You should find a wedding checklist and start out from there. First, book a ceremony site and then a reception venue. Or find a place where you can have the ceremony & reception in one location. Join other wedding websites to get ideas and inspirations as well. Is your wedding going to be small? The best thing to do is invite only the ones you see and talk to frequently. Hope this helps!"
13222,87507,"Just so everyone knows...it was a budget of $1,000 for the venue alone. Every venue i like is like double that. We need the chairs and tables to be involved in that $1,000. We are planning on cooking ourselves and hopefully decorating ourselves as well. I live in Everett, WA...i looked at state parks but i can't figure out how to request information and a lot of them close at dusk. Ugh. If only i can find a venue i just know everything else will fal into place!! That is the only thing that is holding me back...FINDING A VENUE. We don't have a budget quite yet for the rest of our wedding...just the venue. We want it to be beautiful...but obviously not spend too much. 

THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR RESPONSES SO FAR...I APPRECIATE ALL THE SUGGESTIONS!!! :)"
13220,974,"I have done many weddings & other private functions there. While the facility itself is very nice, there are several fairly major issues I have with the place, but am somewhat reluctant to post them in a public setting like this in that we still have to work there.

However, I recall seeing a segment a couple of years ago on one of the numerous reality wedding shows, where the wedding planner had a major nightmare with them.  It seems the decor the bride wanted went against the grain of what Martin's thought was best, & the flurry to get the ambiance they were looking for exhausted them all right before their wedding.

Suffice it to say this was NOT an isolated instance.  Write me directly for more details if you'd like.  I don't know if I'm permitted to post an address here...it's probably safer to go to our website, or our vendor page here at WeddingWire, (it's posted in the FAQ section).

(No scam, no sales pitches, I promise, just the facts)

Best wishes...

13065,974,"On average you're probably looking at somewhere between $600 to $1000, depending on the level of DJ you're looking for.  Some of the more popular ones go for even more.

It should be noted that many of these, particularly on the higher end, work through an agency.  Generally speaking the rates at an agency are going to be higher.  That said, you also get the security of the agency should there be a problem.

However, there are a number of independent DJs around that will charge significantly less, much to the consternation of the other high priced DJs ;-)

Remember that price does NOT necessarily equate to quality, in spite of what the American Disc Jockey Association (ADJA) would tell you.  It may take a little more work to find them, but if you've got the time you can save significantly going with an independent. Just remember to ask LOTS of questions about what might happen if there's a problem.

Document everything you told us on one piece of paper and keep a journal with dates. Then go back to them and demand your money back. If they give it to you, fine. If they refuse, document that too, and if you have the energy take them to court for it. If not see it as a blessing that you just lost $500 and not your whole wedding to these bozos!

Ask friends and find a place where you've got people who used them and you know it's reliable.

12986,87782,"Consider money as you are planning everything. Weddings can get super expensive and they go by very quickly. We managed to have over two hundred guests and kept the price below a thousand for everything. Many couples plan to have everything, but budget for nothing or when the time comes, they end up in MAJOR debt. Believe me, That's NOT how any marriage should start!
First, Think about the timing of your wedding. If it's mid morning, you should plan on having to serve lunch, If it's mid afternoon, Dinner. A 1:00 wedding is appropriate for finger foods, (easier) Also, When it comes to pictures, if you're willing, think about photography students. I went to the college and asked for the best student. I have HUNDREDS of beautiful pictures  and I only had to paid the guy a hundred bucks. The guy wanted to do a good job since he was still a student and his professor even threw in a free canvas just for the opportunity- I also let them use our photos in their portfolio...a double benefit."
13233,11063,"I think you should pick whichever goes with the formality of your wedding.  If your wedding is very formal, I would go with the long length.  If it's a little less formal, go with the tea length.  Whatever length you choose, keep in mind the ages of your flower girls and don't pick something totally age-inappropriate for them.  You might also want to keep your venue in mind also.  If you have stairs that the girls are going to have to walk up, I would suggest tea length because they could trip (sorry, that's the mom in me talking)!  Good luck, I know they'll look adorable in whatever you choose."

13192,85678,"Being the mother of a bride to be myself, here is my advice. Please feel free to print it off and show it to your mom, it may help if she sees it through another MOB who went through the same thing as a young bride in 1975...
MY day was decided by my wealthy MIL, my hairstyle,my decor,my food, the place of our wedding, etc..and because I wanted to please her,I let her run the show. It was HER day NOT mine, or so she thought.  If I had been able to make my own choices without fear of intimidation, bad feelings,or stressful relations, I would have had much fonder memories of my wedding day. I hated my hair style,the place of our event was a frigid,smoke filled hall, and I wanted to be married outdoors since it was late June. I never forgave her for the sadness I felt over not being able to enjoy what every bride dreams of, making HER day HER way.  That is a priviledge your mom should share,not own.  Good luck dear.
I hope your mother will reflect on "
13086,43575,"Thanks thats so kind of you :) I been looking at other sites as a back up plan. If the situation gets worst. Its just so weird because they were soooo good at first, i talked to the people that were getting married at the time when i visited and they just RAVED about them. So I just dont know. My FI said that I should worry because our wedding is 6 months away but still..... its not im emailing them every day. How hard is it to answer 2 emails?"
13222,87507,"Thank you Chermaine, but i'm living in Everett, WA. So LAS VEGAS is out of the question. But if i were living there, you better believe i would be in line!! Our total budget would be approximantly $3000 for the WHOLE wedding. Possibly less...that would be the maximum. "

13192,78470,"To avoid anyone's emotions getting in the way (her or yours!), you may want to consider writing her a letter explaining how you feel.  Be sure to emphasize how excited you are to be sharing this special time with her and how much you value her input, but also that you want to work with her as a team, meaning that before any decisions are made you need to be properly consulted.  Explain how you can appreciate her excitement for all of this, but that it really upset you when she went ahead and booked a reception site before you even saw it. You could say that you want this to be a fun and enjoyable time for both of you, but that it will only be that way if she respects your wishes and doesn't make any decisions without you.  
Hopefully if you can clearly and respectfully get all your thoughts on paper and let her read it when you're not around, it will give her a chance to digest what you have to say without the opportunity for either side to get upset and start yelling.  Good luck!!"

Choosing my bridesmaids dresses was kind of stressful, but really not that big of a deal in the end.  I browsed online a lot and found 5 dresses that I really liked.  I emailed links to the dresses to each girl, asked them to find a store in their city that carried the line and then go try them on and report back to me on how it looked.  Within 10 days they had all been able to go to the store, and it was narrowed down to 2 based on what the girls liked.  From there, I went to a bridal store in my town and looked at fabric swatches so I could see all the color options in person.  I made a final decision on which dress and chose the color (with input from my bm's), then had the girls call in their measurements and place their orders.  Whatever you do, be sure that all your BM's order their dresses from the same shop so there are no differences in color!"
13242,11063,"I agree, hit up the dollar stores!  They usually have a pretty good selection of large vases and bowls for really cheap.  Candles are very inexpensive to decorate with, and can look really nice.  You can also get some large flowers (like Gerbera daisies) and float them in the bowls, so it doesn't take a lot of them but it looks nice.  Costco also sells flowers wholesale, so check out them and Sam's Club for some good deals.  It really can be done!  Look around online a lot for ideas as well, and be creative!  :)  Have fun."

I freaked out three weeks into our engagement too. lol I think no matter how long your engagement is, that's the point when the chore of planning a wedding takes place. 

Just take it slow. You have plenty of time. Go for the venue now. I started looking in Jan. of this year and found that even a year and a half a few venues were booked. Once you have a place for both the wedding and reception, everything else is easy from there. 

At this point if you are at the freak out point. Put the wedding plans aside for a week or two and then come back to it. Don't take it on all at once. That's the good thing about having a long engagement, plenty of time to plan at your own comfort."

Itll be nice and no where near redneck weddings but all I hear from friends and family now is that we are going to have drinking camels.

I have an idea that just might work for you. There is an online wedding dress store called House of Brides. They carry bridesmaids dresses and more, at a discount. If you link through from my website - www.newrulesofengagement.com - you will even get free shipping! They honestly have tons of styles and this way, everyone, no matter where they are located, can view dresses and purchase them online. They have an entire tailor's section and they will help you with fittings/sizes etc. I hope this helps!!

12934,87782,"advice from a cheapo- My wedding was under  $1000...for EVERYTHING! :)
*Flowers- Go silk! They're usually cheaper, last longer, can match hard-to-find-colors and don't attract bees.
*Cake-contact the local bakery/school. They'll make it a project and it IS way cheaper than getting a professional, and no one will know.
*Pictures- Call a college. Students ALWAYS need extra money and the professor can reccomend a student that will do the job right and be professional(you can pay students less b/c they haven't graduated yet and you get hundreds of awesome pics for cheap)
*bridesmaids- my bridesmaids brought their favorite little black dress. It saves you time & money, plus they will love being in a dress that they can wear again and they know they look great in too.
*Ceremony- finger foods! not many ppl care about the meal as long as they get CAKE!!
*DJ??- Load your IPOD with a few hours of your favorite music and have a always open dance floor. People will do ANYTHING at weddings."
13033,83995,"LoL - I saw that one! I felt bad for that bride, but she seems ok! "
13260,83995,"I've been to a wedding at Emerald Gardens, which used to be owned by the same people as Rainbow/Sunset. It was VERY nice, and a lot of fun for everyone. I happen to think they're a little overpriced for what they offer, (since other places charge less), but you can bet it will be a nice time, for sure."
13229,85132,"I have a few people that I can recommend who would be available to do it on site. I am having a COUTURE Bride 101 workshop on May 10, 2008 and they will all be at the workshop to speak on making sure your hair and make-up compliment your gown, how to pull together a timeless look, what to expect when hiring beauty professionals etc. Their will also be a question and answer period. I would suggest you attend just to get insight on their professional background. Furthermore, I also suggest trying a Salon Plaza. I believe there is one located in your area. They host several (like 40-50) hair and makeup professionals all in one location. I would suggest walking around and seeing if any of them catch your eye."
13086,43575,"I went last friday and according to their voicemail they have to be open on friday, sat, and sunday between noon-4pm for tours. I had a job interview and since the location of the venue was only one more exit south. I got there at 11:45 and waited till 12:45. "
13057,85132,"Of course it is possible! The most common mistake that people make as it relates to their budget is having toooo many people and not enough money.

13241,83995,"I'd say your parents, since they're paying for the wedding. Typically, the bride does most of the planning, working with her planner and her mother, naturally ;) I'm sure it's up to you, but I think you should word your invites with your parents hosting. 

BTW -have you considered talking to a wedding coordinator/planner? My cousin had issues with allowing venues to let her boss cater her wedding (She manages a high-end restaurant in town), and she finally settled on the Sienne Golf Club, because they allowed outside catering. I know that's not your issue, but it seems like you need a little help in the venue department, and a planner would be able to help you quite a bit! Good luck! :)"

13242,81595,"That is a great idea. We are working with a florist that will rent the use of large hurricane vases with either pebbles or sand in them. They are adding shells and pillar candles for our beach themed reception. A ring of flowers will surround each vase which sits on a mirror and then 3 votive candles will be on the outside. The rental fee is very reasonable and I don't have to worry about making anything myself or asking friends to do the setup for me. My florist is very reasonable. She's Rosanna at Party Posies in Torrance, just in case you don't have a florist yet, she's the most reasonable I've found. www.partyposies.com In fact, we got a package deal from her where she provides the flowers, photographer, DJ, and can even do day of wedding coordination.

Bridal stores all over the country carry their lines, so I'm sure your bridesmaids in Ohio and Illinois could easily find a store near them that carries the line.  I suggest that you browse their webites and write down the style numbers of dresses you like, then email them to your girls and they can go to a store near them that carries the designer line and try them on.  That's exactly what I did (my bridesmaids are scattered across the country).  Once you choose your dress and color, have each of the girls get measured at a local store and then call their measurements in to one store in your hometown and they can have their dresses shipped to them.  Good luck!"

13261,39625,"Might I suggest something like a brunch?
My third wedding (have a look at my page and my website, you'll understand lol) is a brunch at the Hilton hotel in my parents hometown. The cost started at $25.00 a person, but of course my parents ideas and wants inflated the cost to $55.00/pers. 

It can be inexpensive if you don't care about the extras like food stations and alcohol. Since it's a brunch it would be held at 11:00am, so typically the only alcohol you should be serving if any is champagne, like mimosa's.

It's different from other weddings, and will be very special. Check your local hotels or restaurants for Sunday brunches. They may be able to accommodate you with a private Saturday brunch for your wedding.

Hope this helps.
Good Luck!
 "
13261,87455,"Hi,
What you can do is either have a cocktail reception and serve lots of hor'dorves, non alcoholic beverages,and the wedding cake. Or, you can have a brunch on sunday. I was told that its cheaper to have your wedding reception on a friday and sunday. You can also check out restaurants too. That way you don't have to worry abour renting linens, chairs, dinnerware and dinnerware stuff. I believe some restaurants don't charge for a site fee but you should check into it. Hope this helps"
13272,87455,"How about champagne color or a nice bright pink. Hope this helps"
13242,87455,"You can do candle votives with rose petals scattered on the tables. Or maybe a silk submerged flower in water in a vase. Another idea would be is to use a bowl and add colored gems with a floating candle. Check your local dollar stores, walmart, kmart, michaels, AC Moore, and Christmas Tree shop (if you have one there). Hope this helps"
13248,974,"It's really tough to give any decent suggestions without having some more information.

For example, most of the rooms right in DC proper are usually priced quite a bit higher than their suburban counterparts.  Parking is also an issue in DC, as are the logistics of getting a bunch of folks from out of town down into the heart of that nightmare we call DC traffic!

What are your preferences in terms of the kind of location?  Is a hotel ballroom OK, or were you looking for something more unique?  If you were to consider the suburbs, which way is best for you...NoVa, Montgomery/Frederick County, or PG/Charles?

Also, how many guests are you looking at?  Most rooms can handle 100-150 pretty easily, once you hit 200 the number of locations start to decrease, & if you're looking at 300+ you're getting more limited or really expensive.

Fill in some of the blanks and I bet we can come up with some pretty good suggestions for you.

13255,88487,"I looked at David's Bridal a few times for my bridesmaids dresses. I really wasn't impressed. Because either they were too expensive, or they had cute styles but not always in the color you wanted. It got kind of ridiculous and I gave up.
I ended up ordering them online from http://www.houseofbrides.com/
I picked out some dresses I liked, finally settled on one, and told them try the same dress on at a store that carried the one we wanted to order. We wrote down the size and ordered the dresses. Of course, only one of the bridesmaids tried the dress on before we ordered all of them, so they still needed to be altered. But it was a good idea. Plus, you can find good brands that are usually cheaper on that website. That's also where I ordered my wedding dress."

Another idea, maybe very dark navy instead of black, and another lighter shade of blue as an accent?

The Bride told me it was about $200 including the stand.  
I also found these and liked them: www.scrollinabox.com/Store.html
You could also print it yourself and put it in a pretty frame-depending on the size of your wedding, you may need a pretty large frame, but you can customize it to fit your decor.
If these are not what you're looking for, you could probably get it printed at any sign shop in your area.  Good Luck!"

13290,48751,"When you address the invitations it should have the names of all members invited on the inner envelope (kids included).  On the response card it usually says, 

M____________________________(and the invited writes ""r. and Mrs...and family"" or ""s and her name)

______ Accepts        ________Regrets   

then you could have a space that says, 
""Children under 12  _____""    (or whatever age you'd like to set)

Just a thought: if you don't know the (approximate) ages of their children, do you know them well enough to include them in the invites?"
13291,70831,"OMG - that is a real cute idea!"
13255,70831,"Well - I was in your shoes. I hated everything at Davids Bridal and House of Brides. So I ended up going to this little bouquet and fell in love with ""all"" dresses. The only bad thing is, they don't have a shop in Ohio. Maybe your bridesmaid and come out for the weekend and get fitted then. 

http://www.lajolimode.com/

The website doesn't do much for the store. The environment is not like any other bridal store. Your rep is with you the entire time and not running to help someone else. I know a few girls that bought dresses here and loved them. 

Hope this helps. "

I'm getting married in 01/09 and my save the date are scheduled to go out at the end of this month. I to created my own (puzzle peices)and I'm very excited to ship them out.

I have a pickup dress and my BM have watermelon dresses so for the flower girls i did a pickup dress with a watermelon ribbon and watermelon flowers to throw so everything ties in together. Maybe you should go with the one closest to your dress and throw alittle ribbon around the dress thats like your BM. Just a thought. hope that helped!"

Unless you can find a really nice pump that you like, go with the shoes that you saw.  They could always wear sandalfoot pantyhose if you're worried about them being cold!"
13261,62458,"As someone already suggested, having your wedding on a Friday or Sunday will save you money.  Even moreso if you did it on a weekday.  Seek out places which are owned by the city or county where you live such as recreation centers.  These places very often offer space at a discounted rate for their residents. Also think of places that are outside of the box, like art galleries or community centers.  These are venues who are sometimes looking to get into hosting more special events and will offer you great rates.  Good luck!"

They tried on the dress to see the style and size, it was at David's Bridal!"
13016,88158,"It started out as a way to help the bride and groom out with a little spending money for the honeymoon. I've only really seen it in the south. I love the idea though.

"
13299,56581,"I would suggest that if your colors are black and white that you let your BM's pick out their own black shoes or let them wear something that they already own. Chances are that if they are wearing long dresses that no one will notice that they have on different shoes and you want your BM's to be comfortable. As a BM three times, I was grateful to be able to wear shoes that I already owned or that I got to pick out.

13309,56581,"Mrs. Etiquette would say that all of your invitations should be handwritten, but this is changing. I think the majority of modern day wedding guests do not expect you to handwrite all of your invitations, so either way works. If you want to go for the middle ground, type/print all of your return address labels and handwrite your guests' addresses. If not, go for the printing!!!!!"
13286,56581,"Like you, my partner and I are very liberal and feminists. More than non-religious, we are both atheists as well... Thankfully, our families know this and understand that we plan on creating a wedding that is about us as a couple and not the material trappings of a typical wedding or upholding traditions we don't value... In your situation, if it important to your partner's family that you folks have a religious wedding, consider finding a more liberal minister of their faith and discussing an interfaith/combination ceremony that respects the family's faith as well as incorporates your beliefs as a couple. Try to compromise about the location, like near or around a house of worship rather than within its walls. "
13297,56581,"The easiest thing seems to be that the mothers could wear black-and-white and/or pink outfits. Silver would also look great with black and white... Other than that, I would say that they should be comfortable in the color that they are wearing."
13308,61169,"Usually, after the cocktail hour the guests are seated and the wedding party is lined up to be introduced.   After introductions, the bride and groom, most of the time, stay on the dance floor and do their first dance.   Sometimes, they invite the wedding party and/ or guests to join in, but not so much anymore.   Then there is a toast- usually done by the best man and then the first course.  The father- daughter and mother- son dances are usually done at some point during the meal and the cake is usually cut right after- or towards the end of dinner.   More and more the couple is choosing not to make a ceremony of the cake.   It is a moment for them and whoever happens to catch it.   As a planner in Philadelphia, I see lots of variations on this and some very interesting ways of making this unique.   Good luck and remember- it's your wedding!   Make it your own.   "

13261,89086,"Like others have said you can have the wedding on a Fri or Sun.  
My suggestion would be to have weekday early evening ceremony in the local state park or on the Beach or have it at a VFW/American Legion/Fire Hall for a cheap price.  Call a local catering company like Beefalo Bob's and order food(no more than 400 for the food) and get a wedding cake.
Hope this helps.  Depending on your Officiant they may be a member of the VFW or American Legion."
13318,89086,"Do the pig roast and bbq, have the wedding cake and 4th of July cake, dont worry about the color of the dresses because it is about both of you.

BUT, we're having a really small wedding, which kept the cost down.  If you can address them by hand, I would, and that's the rule.  That being said, I wouldn't at all be offended if one came to me with a typed address, especially if you can print the addresses straight onto the envelopes.  I do think printed stickers look kind of tacky."

13138,19079,"If you choose a plain edge veil white, diamond white, and eggshell should all be fine.  They are very sheer so the color difference will be minimal except at the comp where the veil will be gathered and the color more concentrated.  If that area is disguised by your hairstyle it still shouldn't make a difference.

If you are looking at veils with an edge (pencil, satin, lace etc.) it would be better to go with eggshell or diamond white.  The white may be too much of a contrast.  Good Luck."

but if you do...i also think silver or maybe a gold would look nice. Or maybe even a different shade of pink that the girls are wearing. 

What about a two toned dress, pink and silver?

sorry that was just a stream of thoughts coming out all at once :)"
13333,54547,"You sit at what is called a ""sweetheart's table"", have your wedding planner or organizer set it up so that is placed away but not too far away from everyone, and looks like another table. It is the norm. I find that these days a lot of people do not want to sit with the bridal party and will not choose a family, so they sit at the sweetheart table. Good luck. "
13308,83562,"I just emailed my DJ about the same thing.  This is her reply.

A ""typical"" reception would look like this:
 
6pm: reception begins
6:15-6:30p Grand Entrance and main announcements
7p Blessing (optional, not all people have a blessing at the wedding before food, but some do)
7p Dinner served
7:15-7:30p Toasts
8p Cake Cutting (this can also be done later on if you want)
8;15p first dance, bridal party dance, father/daughter, mother/son dances
8:30p open dance floor
9:15p Garter removal, toss, and bouquet toss.

Then after the reception I'm going to have a 4th of July celebration with only family and our closest friends (probably just our bridal party and their spouses and kids).  That's where we're having the barbeque and stuff (hamburgers, ribs, potato salad, etc. plus whatever food we have left over from the reception before).  You can go about it that way instead of following with a patriotic theme throughout the whole day (especially considering your date isn't actually July 4th).  Hope this helps!

These allow for dramatic centerpiece options.
have fun!

13318,30382,"You can have so much fun on the 4th.

have a beautiful ceremony and use the pinks with whites and add in some soft blues like Delphiniums.
Romantic and summer in feel.

 If you are doings a BBQ add in fun touches with white Daisies and summer flowers, then at the reception use the same colors but in the traditional blends of red white and blue.
Place sparklers on the wedding cake for a photo op as you cut the cake.
 You can even do a cupcake tree instead of the traditional cake,just decorate with tiny star candies!

Have fun!

13318,85132,"Instead of going with the traditional Fourth of July red, white and blue I would suggest playing with the theme of fireworks. Fireworks are an essential party of Fourth of July. You can still use the pink dresses and could use  catch phrase like you light up my life. You could also do fireworks as favors.  would suggest taking them out of those cheesy boxes and putting a bow on them or just wrapping them in the cheesy box. As far as the actual BBQ did you want to have the grill going like a picnic or were you just looking for BBQ food?"
13309,85132,"As the previous responders have stated it is up to your discretion. However, I would like to give you some things to take into consideration. How many people have you invited? Who would be addressing all of your invitations? Handwriting the invites would mean you need the envelopes with you. That may make it difficult to work on away from home (like on your lunch break). Whereas if you opt for typed you can do that anywhere there is a computer. Furthermore, there are a million different kinds of labels including clear ones so you should be able to find something."
13255,85132,"Another way to solve this dilemma is to allow your brides to do different shades, styles of the same color. That way they are guaranteed to be happy with what they choose and it gives an added touch of character to wedding party presentation."
13309,58712,"Proper etiquette is to hand write, but as some of the others have responded these times are changing. I am in the bus. of invitations and have seen girls who are handwriting them, getting them done in calligraphy, having a friend with very nice handwriting do them and in the past year or so I have had girls who are using the clear address labels, I wouldn't use white, colored or designed labels. There are certain company's that when you order your invitations they will offer you to have the address printed with the same font you chose for your invites, this is so convenient, sometimes pricey but well worth it. Most invites are inserted into an envelope that does not get sealed, then placed in the actual mailing envelope. If you choose to use labels, please don't forget you will need to hand write the first names only of those who are invited on the inner envelope, this really should be hand written to make it more personal.Good luck, Hope this helped

12403,89443,"I am using candles as my centerpieces.  I didn't want flowers because in my opinion they can make the table look ""busy"".  Granted, there are many tasteful floral arrangments out there, but I prefer the clean, simple look of candles.  I think it will make your room look elegant, and if anything, you guests should comment on your unique approach.  I found brown mosaic candle holders at Kohls (small hurricane lanterns and round bowls), and because we're getting married in November, my fiance suggested we place them on a scattering of leaves (great idea... I was proud of him!).  Anyway, just do what is right for your budget and what will give your room the overall look you are going for.  Chances are no one will notice the absence of flowers on the tables."

13200,58712,"These look great! I am in the bus. of invites and save the date sales, and these are very professional looking. I would recommend 4-6 months for mailing them out, that is plenty of time for out of towners to find accomodations and make flight plans, and still get good deals. If you send them to soon, guests may put off there planning till closer to the date, which give them time to forget about it. Invites are usually sent 6-8 weeks prior to the RSVP date. So that gives your guests a 4 month time slot to get there travel arrangements taken care of before receiving your invites, which is a sufficient amount of time to do so. One other thing is that magnets are usually your best bet because they can go right on the frig, file cab. etc. as a constant reminder. Good Luck and great job on the design. Best wishes Missy"

You fiancee's father needs to check not only the state website, but call the county in which you are getting married.  He may need to file a special form, pay a small fee or worse case...not be allowed to perform ceremonies.  Check it out before your wedding, so you don't end up at the county court house getting married to make it legal the next day.  Of course you can also get married at the court house and then your future father in law can just perform a spiritual ceremony and not worry about the legal aspects of your ceremony.

If you both love the outdoors, use potted herbs or plants as the centerpieces, and let guests take them home. You love to sew? You could have guests sign the fabric on a light colored quilt you have sewn instead of a guestbook. Or you could send them a square, have them sign it, and send a pic of the completed quilt with you Thank You cards. Personalized sewing kit favors are less than a dollar a piece. "

I love the Alfred Angelo dresses, so I told the girls and they each found shops in their area that sold AA.

In my experience, strictly acoustic music on the beach isn't a great idea because if it's really calm you might hear it but if the wind kicks up (and it will!), the sound will be blown away.  I always use a battery powered sound system and microphones for all of my outdoor weddings because I feel that it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it!  Besides, I can turn one of the speakers around so that the bridal party can hear the music too so you'll know what's going on!  With a sound system you are guaranteed beautiful music whether you hire a solo guitarist or a group with strings, winds or any combination.  You also have the option of a microphone for you and your officient up front so that the really important stuff can be heard too.  Best of luck to you!"

Secondly, it is obvious that Bands cost a great deal more than DJs. Now, I could afford a band for my upcoming wedding, just don't want one.  Reason, I was in one of my best friend's weddings about 2 years ago and she was so excited to book this band-extremely popular and supposed to be the best!  Cost was somewhere around $5K.  Now-I will tell you, she seemed to think her wedding was unbelievable, etc... but secretively, I felt that her wedding was the most boring wedding I had ever been to - because noone was dancing or seeming to have a good time.

You must ask yourself and your fiancé what elements are most important to you. You can set a small budget of $300 to $500 for your reception, but this all depends on what you have available in your budget and what you want to spend. You can spend less by using what is in season, incorporating other elements into your centerpieces to reduce the amount of flowers, or forego flowers all together and use other options.

13441,39625,"Meet with your caterer, and fix the menu. If you're having a sit down dinner you may be able to change it to something that's price accommodating.
If you're having a buffet, you might want to see if there are extras you added in that you can cut out. (Like food stations)

You may be having an open bar, if that's the case - close the open bar, and ask the venue if they can provide table wine only, during the evening.

Are you having a wedding cake? An alternative to a wedding cake, is wedding cupcakes and their inexpensive (I have a bakery and we charge 2.50 a cupcake). Or a decoy cake (a fake cake). Most buffets include a dessert buffet at the end, so you might want to get a fake cake.

Flowers may be another thing you can cut back on, head to your florist and let them know that this is your budget for flowers, and there's no wiggle room. They can suggest beautiful flowers! But you'll have to be flexible because they might not be able to have calla lilies drapped everywhere!

13440,90127,"I am in the same situation! But from what I have read/heard, it is not really great etiquette to include the registry cards in with the invitations, because you don't want to come off that you're expecting gifts. People that were not invited to the shower that want to get you a gift will most likely ask someone close to you (or you yourself) where you are registered. Otherwise, they will probably give you money. And if you especially are looking towards the monetary gifts (as me and my fiance are), they are more likely to do that if there is not a registry card.

We essentially agreed to disagree and in the end, they support us in our decision to be joined. A wedding can mean different things to different people and for us it's a celebration of our new life together.

13209,88481,"Hi Jessica,
Wedding dresses tend to run a size or 2 smaller than normal so if you wear a 4 it street clothes, you should probably order a size 8 wedding gown.  If you are interested in dresses that are not typical wedding dresses, than a 4 should be true to size.  Most  wedding dress designers are a little tricky with their sizing.  If you are an 8 in wedding sizes, you are in luck!!!  Most samples are size 8 and 10 so you can go to any bridal store and all the samples you try on will fit great.  If you do not want to go through the ordering process and would rather buy off the rack, there is a great online boutique called www.bridepower.com (their store is in Boston and it is called Vows.)  they sell designer samples at discount prices.  Tell April that Lindsay in LA sent you and she will take very good care of you :)  Once the dress search is done, check out www.justincases.net for all you other wedding planning needs.

12743,88481,"That is such a great idea.  My only other suggestion would be to incorporate the puzzle pieces into your vows (if you are writing them) or have your officiant say a few words along the puzzle theme.  Maybe finding each other was like ""searching to find the perfect fit"".  Once you met ""you really clicked"".  When you do a puzzle it is easiest to start with the border, the outside.  The wedding is celebrating the creation of your outline, your guide, your path and it is up to you two to fill in the blanks and make it whole.

When your stress level rises and your fiance is there...just walk away to another room or go out somewhere to blow off your steam. The last thing you want to do is push your fiance over the line and he may want to leave for good. When you do take it out on him...just apologize and calm down for a few minutes. Are you planning this wedding by yourself? if so, delegate some wedding stuff for him to do. Its not fair for you to carry this on your shoulders. Everything will run smoothly without blowing up. If its too much for you to handle...set up a meeting with your bridesmaids, family, and fiance to tell them you need help. I'm pretty sure they would love to help you out. That is what they are there for. You will be fine...just take it easy and don't overdue it. "

If you haven't selected your menu what you can do is a heavy hordourves and a light dinner along with wine only and a cake. Check out your local grocery store  or restaurants and see what kind of catering they can do. As for flowers, talk to your florist about your budget and see what she or he can do. Or buy flowers from a wholesaler and DIY. Just look over your list and see what isn't really important. Just keep it simple. The best way is DIY projects.

13286,23809,"I totally understand where you're coming from. My advice would be to have the wedding and tweak it to avoid confrontation whenever possible. If you decide not to go with a minister, have some non-denominational guy throw in a religious (but not too religious) thing or two for the parents. Maybe a reading, a song, or stomp on a glass if you're Jewish! Just any little throwback to religion so the parents realize that you respect them and their beliefs. At the same time, make the rest of the ceremony about the two of you and your love for each other, glazing over the whole ""marriage is a holy sacrament"" thing. 

Basically, if religion is not central to your lives, it shouldn't have to be a central part of your ceremony, but a few traditions here and there to appease the parents and remember where you come from wouldn't kill you.  =)"

We submitted a request online to our county clerk, showed up in person, signed our names and we were done.  A lot of states require physicals and/or blood tests, though, so check on that.  I would think a quick google search on your area + marriage license could point you in the right direction.  There are different timing issues as well - like you have to be married w/in X number of days from getting the license.

In other states, it's less time, and my brother was telling me that in North Carolina (where he was married), there's a waiting period from when you apply to when you can pick it up."
13480,11063,"It depends more on what the requirements are in Arizona.  Some states do not recognize the online ordained ministers, but most do.  My fiance is actually ordained and he married our friends, and our friend is also ordained and is doing the same for us!  I think it's great, it makes it very personal, and it gives you the freedom to do whatever you want for the ceremony.  I think that if you aren't practicing in a church, or don't feel close to a minister, having a friend or family member do it for you is a great alternative!

Our men (my fiance and his friend) are ordained from the Universal Life Church online, and it's totally legit."
13456,30382,"I have designed weddings with NO wedding party,just the happy couple. They ask all present to be their witness and ask 2 friends or family members to sign the certificate if needed.

This is your day,and you can be pretty creative.I'msuremost people are relived to not have the expense of a gown they might never wear again etc.

Plan wisely and have fun!!"
13222,45809,"Your budget is extremely tight but I planned my cousin's wedding with less than that. My cousin and her husband went to the courthouse and got married so all we paid for was the license then afterward we rented a recreation center and they supplied the chairs and tables ($200.00) and we got a catering company for a about $350.00 There was about 50 people at her reception.

13451,56581,"I practice a few stress relievers: 1. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and repeat something positive to yourself. 2. Exercise. I like to dance for exercise, so it doesn't have to feel like a workout if you don't want it to... But even more important than dealing with the stress is dealing with the CAUSE of your stress. If it's all of the details stressing you out, break down what is important to you and focus more energy on the big things and less on the things that don't matter as much to you. Whatever it is, you will feel a whole lot better if you deal with the stressor and not just the stress itself."
13456,56581,"In general, your bridal party is supposed to reflect the the feel of your wedding, so large weddings tend to have large bridal parties and intimate weddings usually have a small court, if any. I am not having any attendants at my wedding, so I say go with what feels right and makes sense to you!"
13465,56581,"If you plan to continue trying to have a relationship with your father, then invite him if it will be meaningful to you. But if you have been talking to him for 18 months and only one other person knows about it, then I would question inviting a relative stranger that you are keeping secret to your wedding just because he happens to be your father... If your wedding is more than a year away, as indicated by the date shown, then you have plenty of time to see how the relationship develops before making a final decision."
13480,56581,"My fiance's father is going to lead our ceremony, which I think makes it more personal and meaningful for us. It is absolutely the right decision for us. In California, anyone can be deputized to perform one ceremony for a fee that is exactly the same fee if you get married at the courthouse, and this is what we are having him do. I looked into similar options in Arizona, and there doesn't seem to be anything. However, if your uncle gets ordained in California, it doesn't seem like it will be a problem. Check out http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00124.htm&Title=25&DocType=ARS and http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00111.htm&Title=25&DocType=ARS.

13451,26284,"Girl I feel you! Sometimes we feel stress and the best person to take it out on is our best friend/fiance. I have done this and I hate the stress! My best advise is the following: I remember why am I freaked out! It's because I am reading mags.I should not be or comparing my wedding to others. Also I remember the most important thing: the union between me and my partner: that is the reason everyone is here (at the wedding) I ask for help and never feel bad about that. WE can do this~ good luck! The men don't typically care about all the details why do we!!!?

13438,72559,"Most of the weddings I work with are destination weddings and also have not met their officiant. I would say maybe at most, 1 in 10 weddings that I see include the officiant for dinner. In our area (South Florida) the officiants don't expect to be included, but that may be something that is looked at differently in differnt regions. "
13499,39625,"In the words of Martha Stewart:
Before you plan your wedding, figure out your budget and expenses. Expect the reception (location, food, and beverage) to account for approximately 50% of the budget. Then allocate 10% each to flowers, photography, attire, and music. The final 10% goes to details like stationery, gifts and favors.

My fiancé and I followed this and we have finally finished all the wedding planning and have not gone over budget. My fiancé got me the Martha Stewart Keepsake Wedding Planner, and without it I think I would have been lost. She does have a free online budget planner that you can print out, and really helps out since it includes all the little details I didn't think of.

13398,91178,"at a august wedding i attended last year, they did use their programs as fans.  however they did not put them on a handle.  they were made from card stock paper and shaped like a cone.  they had about 4 peices (pages) to their program.  they fastened the bottom of the cone with a brad (the little ones you used in grade school, to make moving parts to your projects).  they have a big head and you push them through and then fold the two metal prongs down flat to the paper.  anyhow, they fastened them with a brad which allowed you to spead the papers into a fan.  they looked very classy, and they were very practicle.

13440,17716,"We're toying with the idea of including the registry cards that we received in with the invitiations.  I don't see the issue with it, especially since it's a bother to have to ask about where a couple is registered.

I recently went to a wedding where the couple added the logos of the stores they were registered at on the bottom of the map they included with the invitation.  The map was necessary to get people from the ceremony site to the reception.  This may be a more subtle way to get the word out without detracting from the invite."
13200,17716,"Great Work on the Save the Date!  We did a magnet that we had designed ourselves and mailed them out 10 months in advance.  We have quite a few out of town guests that need to make arrnagements to attend the wedding if they decide to come.  With rising costs surrounding you, airline tix, gas & mail, the more time you can provide potential guests, the more options they'll have on how to travel to your wedding.

BTW, it also helps to make arrangements for a baby sitter."
12796,17716,"I'm in a very similar position.  Some of my coworkers have assumed they're being invited!  Using the disclaimer that you have limited space and budget for the reception is usually the best approach.  You can also say that you're only planning an intimate event.

My thought is to only invite the coworkers you're close to.  Be discreet about it and don't tell the entire office.  If someone doesn't get an invite, they'll get the hint.  "

I go to school full time.  I am planning the wedding. Oh my goodness! So much stress!  Don't feel bad.  I think it's normal.
The only thing I can reccomend is find what makes you calm and relaxed, and do that as often as possible.  And allow some burden to fall on him as well as you."
13465,87015,"I think you should think about how you will feel years from now when people have passed on. How will you feel if when you are married for 10 years? 
Just listen to your heart and don't let anyone else influence you. what about a quiet prayer and alone with God (if you believe anyway) and seek the peace that you need. I think your peace is going to come in a quiet room alone."
13499,56581,"If you just Google wedding budget, you'll get all kinds of information on what you ""should"" spend on your wedding. While some of it is valid for planning purposes, there are TWO important things to start with when considering your budget: 

1. How much do you have to spend and where is the money coming from? 
Once you know you how much you have to work with and/or who is contributing what, you can start to plan. This is your bottom line and you should make a commitment to stick to it. Plan in a little wiggle room and you won't blow your budget like so many of us do...

2. What aspects of the wedding are important to you and your partner?
The internet is filled with what percentages of your budget should be spent on what... really, if you prioritize what is most important, you can spend more on the things that matter and less on the things that aren't as importtant."

My son was married there and we had bare foot weddings do the details. I think they are listed in the directory. 
Favorite locations- Hanalei Bay next to the Princville resort, beach is public and you can be married there even if not a guest. The little flower kiosk in Princeville market area is owned by a friend of mine, she is talented! You can order bokays and leis!!

A Favorite location of ours is Anini Beach, marry at the beach and picnic under the trees. 
Second the spledid Kiluea lighthouse on the cliffs.WOW!!
Or if you love the country take the awesome drive up past the Waimea canyon, To Koke state park, AWESOME greenery and birds, plenty of space for a party here.

13523,41195,"The beauty of your reception is that it is your reception. You can do whatever you like especially here in Fla!

I have seen it done several different ways. Your first dance together right after you are intro'ed or after the cake cutting which usually follows right after the meal are two ways that are pretty common. 

Check with your DJ or band leader, this all should be disscussed in your final consultation with them.

13498,26876,"i had some what of the same problem. My solution was decided on two different style dresses and two different colors but that would go with my color scheme. Best thing is to round up all your girls and take them shopping with you. You'll probably end up choosing different dresses for all of them, but keep in mind that you need to keep the prices as equal as possible. "
13440,26876,"I didn't include the registry cards, but what I did do was I put all the information I wanted my guests to know in a website I had in theknot.com and I printed out little lable stickers with our website and pasted it on the direction cards. I also had it on the save-the-dates as well. You can put any info you want on your website including attire, whats on the menu, accomidations, and even the no cash please part. "
13482,26876,"Its true that it differs between states, not cities. The city goes by the state law. When I did my research I did find the that majority of them required you be married within 30days of getting the license. So the best thing is do the research for your state."
13515,54547,"Hi Mollie,

Before searching locations, you should know a few things. How many guests do you plan on inviting? Where are the guests traveling from? How much, in total, do you want to spend on venue, flowers and other site details? How much, in total, do you want you and your guests to spend on travel and accomodation? These are important questions, and they will be the deciding factors in many decisions between now and August 22, 2009. Send us an e-mail at info@fetefestafiesta.com if you have any questions.  "
13523,54547,"Hi Heather,

In most cases, if you don't have a planner your venue will supply you with a Maitre D' that will be on hand from beginning to end to make sure your event runs smoothly. If they do not supply you with one, you should ask for one. There shouldn't be any additional fees. Anymore questions? Send me an e-mail cassandre@fetefestafiesta.com "
13438,74119,"Hi Jocelyn P,

I have been invited to many reception dinners, but unless I personnally know the couple I usually turn down the invitation. It is not customary to invite the Officiant, but go with what makes you happy. They definately won't feel left out if you choose not to invite them. We know we are there to perform a job and then politely leave.

Occasionally, if you wanted a dinner prayer, you may want to invite the Officiant to help with this, which could lead to a dinner invitation.

I hope this helps you,
The Marriage Mate"

13369,79708,"Agree -Use the resorts/hotels  it will make your life a lot easier. Many offer extras that you would normally pay for on the mainland. I would also recommend using a professional travel consultant. Especially if you are having a lot of guests attend. They know all the resorts and what they can offer. Let them do the work. Your life will be so musch easier. Do your research and ask questions, once you find the right travel consultant they'll do all the work for you.

13498,89120,"Picking a color and fabric (or even just a color) and having each bridesmaid pick out a dress style she feels most comfortable in is a great solution to your problem.  It will make your wedding party more unique and fun and each bridesmaid will be able to feel fabulous for the evening.  If you really want the girls to wear the same style, there are certain styles that tend to flatter most figures such as the princess style and A-line.  Separates are also a good option (a two piece bridesmaid dress such as an a-line skirt and separate top) because they can be very flattering and easier to fit a wide range of sizes.  The most flattering for all figures tend to be simple, elegant designs.  Feel free to email me if you have any other questions: cathy@cathyphillipfashion.com"
13299,89120,"I think a good option for your bridesmaids is to wear a peep-toe shoe, that way they are more winter appropriate than an open-toe but you don't have to go with a pump.  I understand your opposition to closed-toe shoes, you definitely don't want them to look like the shoe would look better in the office.  However, there are some great closed-toe options such as a patent leather pointy-toe heel or maybe even a pretty ballet flat depending on the style of the dress.

13480,61966,"I'm not sure how online ordainment and all that works, but we've decided to have a good friend of our perform the ceremony instead of an officiant. We're getting married in Colorado, and here they allow the couples to self-solemnize the license, instead of requiring an officiant. So my fiance and I are going to technically be the ones officiating the license but we're having our friend read the ceremony for us. I think it makes it a little more special having someone we know do it for us. "
13222,35776,"I understand. My budget is the same amount. I don't live anywhere near you, but I can tell you what I am doing. I am have my wedding at my church which if you have one at a decent sized church they will charge you little to nothing. My pastor will not charge me so I just have to worry about the cost of everything else. My reception is in the church as well and they already have chairs and all that. The pastor does not have to marry you that is up to you, but I just thought I would help out if I could."
13529,71734,"Congratulations on your upcoming wedding.  The maid of honor is the person that plans your shower/bachelorette party and helps with the wedding planning if you ask her to. Also she's suppossed to dance with the best man at the reception and hold your bouquet during the ceremony.  If your maid of honor is married or soon to be a mother, she is called matron of honor.  I hope this helps.  Good luck with your wedding planning & wish you all the best for a happy marriage.

13529,30382,"If your matron of honor (married lady) is expecting,and from out of town I would ask her to do simple things,Maybe help with the favors or wedding programs. Depending on how she is feeling,she may want to do more.  She can be hostess for a bridal shower or tea.

Lots of things pop up that need to be done. 
She should come in a few days before the wedding to enjoy the days with you and the rehersal etc.,She can be the person that you lean on for a laugh and support when nerves kick in.Most of all let her be your best friend!  Thats the best job of all.

Have a wonderful wedding!!"
13520,30382,"Of course you can!
If one is married and the other not, you can have a maid & matron of honor. I have seen as many as 4 honor attendants in some Celtic weddings.

 Do what makes you happy!It's your day!

Best Wishes for a beautiful Wedding!

13511,30382,"Here is one solution that has worked for my clients.  They find a few well trained teenagers in the family that are willing to ""Entertain"" the kids for a few hours at a central location ( of course you will pay them well!!)Parents who cant afford to leave the kids due to long distance,drop off the kids with pillows and PJ's for a Pajama party,if in the evening. The kids get ""wedding cake"" cupcakes work well, and get to play X box, watch videos, create pictures in coloring books etc.
You have the kids checked in with cellphone numbers and any allergy info etc. Its thoughtful and reassuring to parents that the kids are close by and safe!  Everyone has a relaxed and fun time.

13480,48681,"Here's a kicker. My sister is actually an ordained priest. When she was ordained 6 years ago, I knew then and there that I wanted her to be the one to marry me (some day). Now that a wedding is in the works -- I spoke to her about it -- and she refused. She started making up a bunch of excuses (she's from Canada - the wedding is in the US, she'd have to get permission from the Bishop of the diocese, yadda, yadda, yadda).

On maui they are very against building. Trust me, i liked in Makawao and there is no stop lights and like 1 or 2 street lights. I would skip the resorts because they will charge you left and right for everything. Everything is priced WAY WAY high. I would look for a smaller company to do your dealings. The beach land is free so if they charge you to use the beach thats bull. I can understand set up fees and what not but they said oh we are going to charge you x amount of money for the beach. uhhh its free. You can go to a resort beach and its still free because they dont ""own"" the beach. However, some houses has private beaches which is good because not any joe can sit down and watch the wedding.

As a professional wedding coordinator I want to remind everyone that it pays to invest in a DAY-OF COORDINATOR!  Planning the wedding is fun, especially if you're a planner by nature, but, you want EVERYONE to REMEMBER your big day, MAINLY YOU AND YOUR BETTER HALF!  Let the coordinator take the reigns to ensure that your day goes as smooth as possible.  Andrea (Creative Concepts and Advancement)"
13272,89835,"Hi & Congrats!
As a professional wedding coordinator, the trends we're seeing/hearing for this year are crisp white, steel gray and hues of brown.  If you prefer to be bold, why not add watermelon pink!  I believe any of those shades would compliment mint green.  Good luck! Andrea (Creative Concepts and Advancement)"
13057,89835,"Hi & Congrats!
Creative Concepts and Advancement caters to every budget.  Our motto is that it doesn't have to cost a fortune to have an amazing event, we just make it look like it does!  We just coordinated two weddings in the last two months that had the same budget as you.  As a professional, part of my job is to leaverage vendors to ensure you get more bang for your buck!  I'd love to talk to you about your big day to see if we can help.  If you're interested, let me know.  Either way, I'm sure you'll have a beautiful day!  "
13109,89835,"Hi & Congrats!
You should clarify what ""no alcohol"" means...  Sometimes that means that you are not allowed to have ""hard"" liquor but can have beer and wine.  Also, as a professional wedding coordinator, please remember that cheaper is not always better.  At the end of the day, you want to be happy.  Good luck!

12250,89835,"Hi & Congrats!
Do you have a professional wedding coordinator?  I'm asking because that is typically something he/she would love to help with.  DC has so much history, there is so much you can do around this theme.  For example, you can incorporate the Metro (and it's stops), famous restaurants, waterfront and other famous night clubs, President's and First Ladies, sports teams, and the list goes on and on.  Good luck!

13538,30382,"I design Calla pc's all the time for my clients,You can keep it as simple as a tall vase with traditional whites, a trumpet takes 15 stems of big calla, so its pricey.

Use Mini callas in a mini version and you will still have that WOW factor.  Go to my website for some ides! Just click on my link.

Callas can be tricky, so be careful id you area DIY person. cut wrong they will turn to stinky mush! Not something for a joyful wedding day!

Have fun!"
13568,30382,"Before you start traveling, have you asked the church if they would allow you to put up a party tent!
This may be an option if they have the adjacent grounds and parking!!
Ask your local caterer or wedding planner for this info. A planner may also know of hidden gems or private estates that are nearby!!

If you must travel,keep the distance realistic. and space the reception start time to allow for the worst traffic conditions!

Here in the So.Cal. I have seen weddings at historic churches and then the reception 20 miles away near the beach or at Disneyland resort.  But the reception site is usually well worth it.  

Be creative and have a Beautiful wedding!


"
13563,30382,"A second wedding can break the rules, If this is a Casual gathering,
Just make sure you have all the other details ,such as your outfit, hair and flowers in place.  Most brides even 2nds can be a bit excited and scattered on that day.

You can greet your guests and have beverages ready for a pre wedding refresher. Make sure the guests are escorted to the designated cermony spot and have the officiant invite everyone to be seated or gather around you at the designated time and you can exchange vows.

I have seen some wonderful and touching ceremonies for second weddings.  Do what makes your heart happy!

Have a Beautiful wedding!
"
13547,30382,"Dont stress over this toxic person. 
You will be so busy with your beautiful wedding that she will be the last peron you need to even give a thought to.

 If she does attend with Bob, You will be the Gracious and radiant bride that is above any pettiness, That is the best revenge!LOL

She will be envious, and wish it was Her big day!

Smile and enjoy your wedding.

13475,84398,"The answer you probably don't want to hear...it depends.  There are a lot of photographers out there, ranging from the beginner to the most senior in the profession.  In most cases, you really do get what you pay for.  Skillsets range, as well as styles, personalities and packages offered.  If you're working within a budget, you'll obviously want to go with someone that falls in your range.  I truly think the most important...and most subjective...aspect to choosing a photographer is finding someone that you're comfortable with.  When you do, price is usually not a factor.  Your day is important and the photos that tell your story will look the best when you're confident/comfortable with the person behing the lens.

Regards,

John"
13568,1616,"There is no set rule, but I wouldn't suggest having your guests travel for more than 1/2 hour to the reception."
13552,56581,"I have never seen the time capitalized and a quick Google search (for ""wedding invitation wording"") seems to confirm it. I hope your invitations turn our beautifully!"
13552,1616,"It should be lower case on all."
13563,56581,"I am planning on greeting and mingling with my guests before my wedding and it's going to be my first, so I say go for it! That whole tradition of seeing each  other for the first time at the ceremony is not for me, and it sounds like it is not for you in this situation... One of the main reasons behind the tradition is the superstition that it is ""bad luck"" to see each other, and obviously, relationships take a lot more than good luck to be successful! It's is your wedding, so do whatever feels right, not what is expected of you!"
13563,1616,"Because it is a casual wedding and your second marriage, then you can make your own rules and do what you want. "

12330,59886,"I was wonering where you got the thing you put the runner on so it can be unrolled?"
13568,92515,"I actually agree with the previous answer. I would definetly consider the tent. However, before discarding that idea, try not to visualize an actual tent. Doing so my take the elegance out of that idea. Keep in mind that it will start out as just a tent, but by the time it's decorated it can be paradise. Especially if the reception will be after dusk. Picture candles lit all around and lights small white lights strung around the walls. The ""tent"" can be transformed into a ballroom. If you can prevent your guests from driving from the ceremony to the reception than do so. Convenience is always preferred. However, if you must seperate the two events than I would suggest choosing the closest reception hall possible. Congradulations and don't stress! That is key!"
13515,92515,"Congradulations! I would love to assist you in planning the perfect wedding in Kauai. I have a promotion going on now that is offering my services free of charge to my first client gained on this sight. Feel free to contact me via email rhondaboddie@hotmail.com or phone 571-723-9655. "
13499,92515,"The easiest way to set a budget is to just set one! How much money can you afford to spend on your wedding? How long after your wedding do you still want to be paying on it? A ten thousand dollar wedding can sometimes be just as nice as a twenty thousand dollar wedding. There are ways to cut corners and no one notice that you did so. I have a promotion going on now that is offering my wedding planning services free of charge to my first client gained on this sight. Contact me if interested via email rhondaboddie@hotmail.com or phone 571-723-9655"
13015,92532,"And just to add my two cents...If you have hired a planner, my clients usually have used me as their sounding board.  Share your issues and concerns with your planner.  Your planner will not only fill in the gaps for you when needed, but he/she will also be your 'middle-man' when you are having FMIL issues.  Just breathe and whoo-sa, allow the planner to be the heavy, refer her to him/her and an experienced planner will know how to love them up.  The planner, you and your husband-to-be will love, but the mother will realize after the wedding that it was the right choice to a planner.  

Now also realize that parents that give money usually want to have a say.  So you can decide if you would like for her to go with you say for a food/cake tasting (if you have specified what your using the monetary gift for.)   "
12986,92532,"Young bride congrats...I have read that someone did suggets that you and your fiance set a budget.  Yes, many couples do go out there and just spend--spend--spend and realize that after the wedding is over they cannot buy a drink out of the vending machine.  Please set a budget, then interview experienced wedding planners.  Once again, if you need an attorney you wouldn't go to the bank seeking legal advise.  This person(s) will now how to guide and assist you in choosing vendors, possibly colors, themes, and favors.  Very important though, depending on where you are, ceremony and reception sites can be booked 1-2 years in advance, so its very important that get a venue that you will possibly hold your guests.  Then when you get those things set, as one of the responders stated, things will just start to fall in place.  You know what you cap is, you have an experienced professional person on board that can assist with your dream wedding and you have a man that you love and he loves you"
13563,20427,"Personally I think you could do both. But 30 minutes early on the invitations. Greet your guests, 30 minutes before the ceremony, disappear, but on your dress, and someone do your hair and makeup (nothing too fancy because of the time limit, just enough to transform you into a bride) and set up an appetizer thing for the guests. 
This way you get to greet your guests, and you still get the effect of stunning your fiance. "
13026,35429,"Happy honeymoon!!! We are going to Sandals in Jamaica Can't wait"
13026,35429,"Oops sorry didn't realize I had already responded to this one. We ended up switching from Riviera maya, mexico to Jamaica because Sandals is 50% off right now "
13573,61966,"It's a tough decision. You could invite him just to be polite, but not plan on including him in any of the ceremony/important things - especially if you aren't close to him at all. I just can't imagine a dad not wanting to be there for his little girl's wedding, even if he's just a guest. After what he did to your brother I would be very clear about an RSVP policy - for example, if he says he'll be there then make sure he knows you're holding him to it, short of a drastic emergency. At worst you'll invite him and he'll say he's not coming; and on the bright side, this might be the opportunity to patch things up with your relationship. I hope this helps a bit, it's just what I would do if I were in your situation. Good luck! "
13026,21232,"We're taking a 6-day cruise out of San Diego to Baja Mexico. Ports are Cabo San Lucas, La Paz, and Ensenada.  Don't know what to quite expect, but it's a cruise.  What we're really looking forward to is a 1 1/2 days at Comic Con!  That's actually the reason we picked San diego as the port to go out of.  Can't wait to see what new Science Fiction and Horror films and stuff that will be coming out. At Comic Con 2005 I ended up with 6 paintings!!  I'll see if I can resist this time around. :)"
13573,27776,"These situations are always so hard, I would invite him, only for your own sake and peace of mind, regardless of the circumstances, in the end you will know that you tried to mend and the ball is in his court. In the end, and regardless you day will be beautiful and you will live with no regrets, let it be his choice and if he says no, he will have to live with that not you. Good luck and all the best. "
13547,26876,"I agree with Kay, I would just suck it up, and do this for your FH and not for you. And remember what's in the past is in the past maybe she's gotten over it, and so should you. Don't go expecting the worst, but maybe some good may come out of it, you just never know."
13573,26876,"Yeah, I would go ahead and invite him, that way no one can say that you didn't. Looks like you'd want him to be there considering the fact that your even contemplating it. Inviting people to your wedding does not mean they deserve to be there, no one ""earns"" an invitation. You invite them because their special to you and want them to be there to share your special day. You never know, some good may come out of this whole thing. "
13480,26876,"I had our family friend marry us, he was our youth pastor for some time and say us grow up together, so we found it appropiate. The thing was he was not ordained, and was not able to get ordained until he finished some church requirement which would have taken another year. Anyway, he still married us, but obviously he wasn't able to sign the licesne. We had a civil marriage 2days prior. That also an option, and really does not make your ceremony any less meaningful or special. We certainly did not see the civil one as really getting married. "
13480,15248,"Many of the officiates I work with, started out exactly this way, provided a ceremony for a family member and loved it, decided to start their own wedding business. The important thing is to know the laws in your state and if they allow officates to perform ceremonies.  Getting ordained on line is the easy part. The hard part is learning ""how"" to perform a ceremony that makes sense, is legal and is what you want.  Experience is everything when it comes to that part.  If you decide you want an officiate contact me and I will post your request on a site that assists couple to find an offiicate in their area.  Congrats!  and Best Wishes with whatever you decide to do.  Rev Sandy, Maryland (Referral Officer for Region 6, American Association of Wedding Officiants)"
13286,15248,"Find an officiate that will add a little bit of tradition, religion and help you to find that happy medium to make everyone happy.  It is your wedding, but sometimes showing others that you respect their values and ideas can make things easier...the marriage belongs completely to you.  Many officiates are willing to wear ministerial robes and play the part you need them to play.  Either way enjoy your selves...If you need assistance locating an officiate that can help you, just contact me.  I am a referral officer for the national association of wedding officiates, I can get you on the site and find you someone very quickly.  Blessings to you both.  Rev Sandy, Maryland. "
12986,84830,"Soo yea im super excited still haha.... gettin closer to finding a dress and everything...we've kinda been slacking on planning anything tho...i know that's not the best thing in the world but we are gettin near the end of school so that's always good!!... But yea...things are gettin weird and we're gettin mad at eachother for the smallest things lol but that's for a different conversation...anyways..i picked my colors...they are going to be Fuschia & a Pool Blue( or a bright blue)  so yea.....good times!!! and  yea we will figure out the budget sometime..hah.."
13326,46106,"Thanks for the tip, Andrea!  I couldn't agree more.  I'm 4 days out, and I've got to say I don't know what I'd do without my day of coordinator!  She already has all my stuff (favors, place cards, cake knife, etc.), so I have no worries about getting set up or anything being forgotten.  I'm also relieved that I don't have to worry about everybody being in the right place at the right time because she's going to take care of everything.  She's seriously a life saver, and I'm going to be able to really enjoy my day because of it!"
13550,46106,"Oh my gosh, thank you!!!! =D  I'm so so excited!"
13573,46106,"I think it depends.  Do you want him to be there?  Would it make you happy to look up and see him in the crowd?  If not, I wouldn't bother.  But if there's anything in you that makes you think you might regret it later, invite him.  I'd just try to keep my expectations low (because of what he did to your brother), so you're not disappointed if he doesn't show.

I totally agree, though, that whether he deserves it or not is probably not the best way to look at it."
13480,46106,"While I think that having a family member perform your ceremony can be a very special and personal experience, I think it could also be a disaster.  You'll want to make sure (in addition to all the legal stuff) that it's someone who you trust to write and deliver a beautiful speech.  Is your uncle comfortable in front of people?  Will he give a good ""performance""?  You wouln't want someone who will stutter through it and get shy, or the opposite (maybe worse!) and over act it and attract too much attention to themselves.  A professional officiant would be likely to deliver a quality ceremony.  You just want to make sure that your family member can do the same.  If so, I think it could make your day even more special.

Congratulations and good luck!"
13573,91015,"I would also invite him.  My parents didn't agree with my wedding and even though I invited them, they didn't show up.  It still hurts to this day, but knowing that I did what I could to get them there makes me feel better.  Plus they know that it was their fault for not coming.  I think you should invite him and do your part, and see what happens.  Good Luck!!!"
13537,92857,"You could also go to your local Ikea if you have one. I actually purchased four packs of their large cylender drinking glasses and they are 9"" high. The packs were four for 2 dollars.
Many vendors use kitchen glasses for vases because you can get them cheaply."
13568,92857,"Another option you can do is rent large buses to move your guests from the reception hall to the church and then the reception hall again. That may be an option if the tent idea does not pan out. Have a designated party bus host for each bus and give your guests a treat for the ride to the church."
13523,92532,"Depending on where you are, there is (as a previous responder) stated a designated person that is there for your event.  Now what they are actually going to be able to do, is something you should discuss with the venue site.  It's time now to do that.  This will allow you time to get the important information to your planner/host(s).  Now remember if you haven't seeked the assistance of an experienced planner, its not to late.  This person can handle the day of events.  What make this a great idea is that now you think your turning crazy (not knowing if you have a planner) imagine the day of and no one knows what your thinking or what you wanted to happen at a particular time.  Once the wedding starts your the bride and the ceremony or reception can't pause so that you can correct things.  This person you choose should be able to put you at ease and allow you in enjoy your special day.  Your pictures/video shouldn't reflect your stressful time but your rememerable one.  "
13588,92857,"I truly would not worry about the color of the curtains too much. The good news is that your colors do not clash with them. Make the focal point of the room the tables themselves with eye pleasing displays."
13222,70212,"Hi,

What have you looked at and what have you found so far?"
13086,70212,"Hi I don't know anything about Rainbow Gardens but I would suggest that you show up at the original place on a Saturday night and demand some service (in a nice way of course). Then, also, USE THE BATHROOM.

I went to two affairs at the same place in the past couple of years by the same people, and although the place was nice, the bathrooms got disgusting both times after the first hour or so.

Before you decide to change over to Rainbow Gardens, talk to a couple of people who used them and/or read customer reviews. Also set your appointment on a Saturday night and use the bathroom.

"
13573,88861,"The fact that you are even asking this question means that there is a part of you that wants him there.  I think you may feel some regret later if you don't ask him.  Then it will be up to him to do the right thing... and the right thing may be for him to decline your offer and keep your special day about you and your husband."
13222,85834,"I encourage you to give Jamie a call at Affairs to remember.  She is wonderful"
13283,29611,"I kind of had a similar dilema. My dress has some black highlights in it, but I didn't want just black and white. We're doing royal blue, black, and a little bit of yellow to contrast. It looks really classy and blue and black look great. Charles has a chick on his side and she will wear black where the bridesmaids will wear royal blue. I like it. Good luck."
13550,11063,"Wow, this weekend!  How exciting!  I know everything will be beautiful, and we want to hear all of the details after the fact!  Good luck and enjoy  :)"
13642,39625,"It all depends on the vendor. Most of them will recommend what is more in your price range. 

For instance a 5 tiered cake for $200 is not going to happen, so a baker may suggest a fake cake (5 tiers of styro-foam and icing) and depending on whether you are having a dessert buffet or not she may be able to accommodate you with sheet cake.

The best thing to do is sit down and divide your budget among the things you need and want. This way when you meet with a vendor you can give them your budget number. I suggest subtracting $50-$100 (depending on your number) that way if the vendor does go over budget you have wiggle room.

Good Luck!"
13563,22880,"I think you should do whatever you want on your Special Day, and toss out any traditions that don't feel right to you.  I like the previous post about mingling until 30 minutes before the ceremony starts; I would add that while you're mingling, wear a nice outfit (one that's easy to get in and out of), but not your wedding dress.  Even though you may not be into keeping the dress a secret, it is still a nice touch to have everyone see you walk down the aisle in your special dress.  When you ""disappear"" before the ceremony and appear with your beautiful dress, it adds to the excitement and anticipation of the new marriage.  Just my two cents!"
13604,93550,"Thanksgiving Bride, 
I would say that you need to go ahead and send the ""Save the date"" announcement again.  This is unfortunate, however if there were those that were planning on not attending because of the destination, may make plans to do something else.  Catch them as quickly as you can and make the change of plans to stay in town know ASAP...you will likely have alot more guests able to attend.

Good Luck,

13440,48898,"I used to work at store that had bridal registries and would have all kinds of people, young and old, male and female, come in and see if THIS was the place the couple registered at. So if you are not putting it in the cards, make if OBVIOUS somewhere else. I always thought it was crazy that people had their guests going around to different stores to see if the couple had registered there. Also, you have to realize that not everyone is that internet savvy and may not check websites. Lastly, about the money thing- it they are going to give you money, they are going to give you money regardless of if you registered anywhere. Some people REFUSE to give cash so if they don't know where you're registered at, you'll get another candle or another frame which you can't return b/c you don't even know where it came from!"
13547,48898,"I'm going to be inviting my FH's ex-female roommate who had a major crush and him and was rude to me. Why? Just because I always think it is better to be the bigger person. Also, I figure that day is about only the couple so it is not like she is going to be rude to me or anything just like I am sure this Jessica girl won't have time or be that classless to be rude to you. Also, you won't have to spend time hanging out with her b/c you'll be doing just the meet and greet w/most people at the wedding. That being said, if YOU GUYS are paying for the wedding, it'd be a different story. My FH's parents are contributing which means myself or my father won't directly being paying for her b/c that wouldn't be okay with me."
13604,48898,"I'd suggest sending out new-save-the-dates ESPECIALLY since it is the holiday time that you are moving into. You just don't want people to start planning out vacations from work and things (which I've noticed some people start discussing WAY in advance) and then not have the wedding at that time."
13511,48898,"I'm having our wedding on a yacht and want to use the excuse that children wouldn't be appropriate on the yacht. Basically it is about room, noise level, and costs. However, everyone has told me w/family, you have to let them bring kids or at least set a cut-off limit of age. I have seen the ideas of baby-sitters but I don't know too much on how to get that word out and who to find. My advice, it is your day and if you want to kids then that is your decision. Be careful about allowing some kids though and not others b/c that can be seriously offensive."

I think its a decision that mainly the groom has to decide, based on what HE wants and not so much what Bride wants. The bride already get most of what she wants, this is really the Grooms decision. honestly I find it strange."
13668,26876,"There's no rule about a recieving line, or that you have to have one. I think that you should make the most of going around and greeting your guests during dinner while dancing whenever you have a chance. Thats what I did, I only had about 100 guests. I just felt it was unnecessary to make people wait in line to greet them/us. I sure wouldn't want to. "
13685,93747,"If you and your fiance already have the household items you need I would suggest setting up an online Honeymoon Gift Registry. This way your guests can contribute funds towards a honeymoon. Second wedding or not, you still deserve a wonderful honeymoon."
13684,93747,"This all depends on who needs to get the RSVP. If you are planning everything and need them to go back to you list you and your fiance's names and address. If your planner is keeping track for you, then list her name address. "
13679,93747,"In this situation I would have the groom walk both mothers down the aisle. This is of course if the brides mother does not have a spouse or companion to do so."
13684,26876,"Im not sure I understand the question correctly, but as far for the invitation, usually it would depend on who the invite is written from. If is says something like Mr and Mrs. _____________ request the honour of your presence and the marriage of their daughter, sort of thing, then the Brides parents address would be used, if its written like the bride and groom are inviting, then the brides address if living separately or their address if living together. For the Response card it would go to whom ever wants to be responsible for receiving and keeping track of them, usually the bride. I hope this helps"
13679,56581,"These days, anything goes, so I don't think it really matters to your guests or anyone else who is walking who down the aisle. In any case, you want the person being walked down the aisle to have the person of their choice by their side, and there is nothing wrong with choosing more than one person. So, I'd consider having both mothers walk the groom down the aisle if he can't choose between the mothers, although I assume that his mother would be the obvious choice... Could the mother of the bride walk the bride down the aisle? It is also worth it to talk to the bride about WHY she wants her mom to walk the groom down the aisle and what the groom wants. Addressing the why might help to ease the situation or help you come to a compromise."

13685,56581,"These days, anything and everything goes for second weddings. From my mom's experience as a second-time bride, I would just say try to do the things that you want to and don't think about what other people will think. Do things that are meaningful to you as a couple, register for things you will use and not just ""traditional"" items, wear white, whatever it is. You might do all of the things you wanted for your first wedding but weren't able to do, you might do everything completely differently (after all, this is a different wedding for a different relationship), you may be traditional, or you can throw tradition to the wind, just do what will make you and your partner happy!"

I've been getting the ""are you nervous"" question a lot!  My answer is that I am not even slightly nervous about getting married, but a little about the wedding details I hope I'm not forgetting :)

As far as the crying thing, I've got nothing for ya cause I'm the same way!  Waterproof makeup is all I can say :)  I've been trying to give myself pep talks about how I'll be able to handle it and I'll be too focused on not tripping on my way to the alter, that I won't cry...but then I start to get emotional just thinking about it and I know I've just got to roll with the inevitable.

If not have the mother of the Groom and the Brides Father walk the bride down.

13682,70212,"His mother definitely has to walk him down the aisle. I have never heard of the bride's mother walking the groom down and it makes me wonder if the bride is so upset about this...

Are there complicated circumstances you haven't explained, or is the bride just a control freak? Why would she even think you would have her mother walk you down the aisle?

Please explain circumstances or else I'm wondering if this is a red flag as to whether this would not be a good person to marry.

"
13573,70212,"Invite him and I'll tell you why I say this.

My step-father doesn't speak to his daughter. He also didn't show up at his son's wedding or maybe it was some other event---because he didn't want to see his daughter.

I feel bad for her because she must think he's disowned her...but I know the real reason he's been avoiding her is because he is so ashamed that he didn't pay the child support that he's too embarrassed to see her. So he's making it seem like he's angry and her, but he's really not. He is just too ashamed and doesn't want anyone to know it.

Sometimes people have a hard time apologizing or are so afraid of being rejected or reprimanded that they hide from it.

The second and most important reason to invite him is for yourself. When people do not forgive other people, it ties up their own energy. Forgive him for yourself because when you forgive him, your own energy will be free and your own heart will be more open for yourself, your husband and throughout your life.

The th"
13573,70212,"And the third reason is because when you look back at your life, you will remember that you reached out to him. The alternative is not inviting him and looking back as an older woman b'h', remembering harboring ill will at your own wedding, and when he passes on, remembering that you excluded him.

The first option, whether he shows up or not, you will remember that you included him.

And who knows? Maybe something good will come of this and your relationship. I bet he is having trouble forgiving himself, and so he is terrified that you will not forgive him.

Forgive him and if he is brave enough to show up, have the band/DJ call him up for the father's dance. It could change both of your lives.

Good luck.

OK I would suggest having something soon so you can get him back involved in the family and have the surprising reuinion NOW, so they deal with it now and the attention is on your wedding, on your wedding.

13679,30382,"The best way to diffuse this is have the groom enter with the groomsmen as is traditional. Not walk the aisle.

The Mothers will be escorted by an usher or male family member other than the groom or bestman and be seated before the start of the ceremony.

 The bride is then walked up the aisle with father or Both parents and presented to the groom.

To honor the Mothers in the ceremony have them light the side candles for the unity candle at the start of the ceremony,or do a rose ceremony, where after the couple exchange roses they turn and present as a new couple a rose to each mom. It's a beautiful way to say we love you both!

I am also a wedding and event planner and has had similar situations with many of my brides and grooms. First of all, no matter what, you should sit down with your family and tell them what is in your heart and that you want your Dad to be with you on your wedding day!  If they won't bend, do the right thing anyway! Invite your Dad to your wedding. Life is too short honey and maybe your Dad regrets the past. Please for your own sake, give him the benefit of the doubt. It will be his decision whether he wants to be with his daughter on her on her wedding day.

You did not mention whether the location that you rented is a public or private beach, but will try to answer your questions. First of all, 125 persons is a pretty large wedding. If your guests have traveled a distance to your wedding, you certainly should not ask them to stand or sit on blankets. Decorations, chairs and wedding arches can be rented. You can also work with local florists as well. What about your wedding cake, wedding toast and food and beverages for your guests? Do you have that aspect arranged?

I know how frustrating it is, I was there before, and it becomes so consuming emotionally, financially all the of the above. But, it almost seems kinda selfish to say that if they don't help you, your not going to invite them. After all this is YOUR wedding, and they're not obligated to help you. If they do great! If not then whatever, just do the best you can. I wouldn't want people to feel forced to do something for me, and that they do a horrible job because they don't want to do it to begin with.

As opposed to following tradition and having her Mother walk with an Usher or GM.
It is not the Grooms desire to walk down with the MOB, however he is not opposed for 2 reasons 1) fear of the Bride and 2) he doesnt know general Wedding Etiquette (as they announced their engagement 2 days before my wedding and showed the ring and talked about their plans on my Big Day) So what should he do? In an effort to prevent a family problem and to stop Bride from further distancing the Groom from his family, should I, as a relative of the Groom, let the Groom know this is inappropriate? Or should I say nothing and let them make a mistake?

The groom in this case really needs to tighten up his pants and not be afraid of his future wife. What kind of relationship is that and going to be?

13682,11063,"Um, wow.

I think you should definitely pull aside the groom and talk to him one on one about your concerns for this woman's need to control him.  This is a huge red flag for their relationship, not just a minor disagreement about wedding etiquette.  I would approach it that way also.  Keep things factual, point out your concerns to him and for him.

As far as the wedding etiquette goes, the bride is smoking crack.  I have mixed feelings about my future mother in law also, but she's still his mom.  End of story.  I respect that, I respect her because of it, and I get along with her just fine.  I would never tell my husband to do things with my mom instead of his just because I don't like her as much.  Also, just for the record, you can do the processional anyway you please regardless of your religion.  I am not Jewish, but at my first wedding, my husband's parents walked him down the aisle and both of my parents walked me down (Jewish processional).  Argh.  Frustrating."

He didn't show up, but I know if I didn't try on my end I would regret not knowing if he would have came or not.  Since he didn't come I sent him a small album that I made up on Snapfish of wedding pictures of me my brother and husband, so that he could at least see how his kids have grown and who I married.  I strongly dislike what he has done, but I still love the person he was when I was little girl.  Hope that helps. :-)"

My father screwed up bad, and I don't think that I will ever forgive what he has done to me and my family.

13751,56581,"This situation is a hot mess!

As someone that cares about the groom, I think you should say something to him. Not at least letting the groom know that you are concerned would be the mistake, if you ask me. If he is afraid of the bride AND he is being distanced from his family, there is a major problem there.

And about preventing a family problem, it sounds like the bride may be part of the family problem already... It sounds like this is way beyond wedding etiquette... If you are concerned enough to repeatedly post to this forum, then absolutely, you should tell the groom your feelings. I wish you and your family the best of luck dealing with this situation..."

13475,94455,"I recently got married in DC and used a photographer that my friend recommended very highly.  The company is Roman Grinev Photography.  Roman charges $3100 or so for 7 hours of photography.  His associate, Jason Phillips, was our photographer and he was $2900 for 8 hours (which included an additional hour as a bonus).  www.romanphotography.com  They are very artistic and have more of a photojournalistic (is that word?) style, which is exactly what we wanted.  Very few ugly posed pictures!  We haven't gotten our pictures back yet because it takes a few weeks, but I was very happy with how they worked with us in the months leading up to the wedding.  Jason was also very flexible on the wedding day, going to multiple photo locations with us around DC.  "
13668,94455,"I had my wedding reception (only) on a dinner cruise ship in DC with 115 guests. We also struggled with figuring out how to handle the receiving line.  We decided to go around to each table and greet all the guests after we made our entrance onto the ship. What ended up happening was that most guests were standing up (not at their tables) so we just went from person to person with our parents to greet everyone. We allowed about 45 minutes for that before we did our first dances, but we could have done it in half an hour.  It worked out perfectly!  By doing it at the beginning, not only did my husband and I get to meet each other's extended family we had never met before, but we got it out of the way early so we could relax the rest of the night. I will tell you that people are so thrilled to be able to talk with the bride and groom.  People were constantly telling us how nice is was to be able to talk to us, and how at most weddings the bride and groom don't give you the time of day.  "

Plus, people are already asking us where we are registered."
13642,94857,"I totally agree with being up front about your budget. If your dream is extravagant and you express this to your vendor you will get an extravagant price. But if you tell them you want extravagant and then give your price range you will have get the best possible service for your budget. 

For example, as a cake designer, if a bride and groom come to me with a picture of a 5-tier very ornate cake and say I want this, I would be more than happy to quote them a price. If their budget is $1000+ they will be happy with the quote. If their budget is $400 then they are going to walk out and think I am crazy. But if they would have brought me the picture and said we want this but our budget is only $400 then I would have given them options to turn the cake into a beautiful version of the cake, wether that be making it only 3-tiers and serving sheet cakes, or cutting back on some of the decorative items.

The bride need to understand that his mother will ALWAYS be his mother, and if she doesnt like it then she needs to either not marry him or suck it up and stop and grow up alittle bit. This is something a 5 year old would do on like choosing what mother to being to school. As probably stated before the bride has probably has made tons of choices already to make her day perfect. I actually ask my FH mother about this and they are very close and she said she would be very hurt if she couldnt walk her son down (its her first to get marrried). I know I'd never do something like that to my FH. She needs to learn how to compromise or this groom will probably be in hell for the rest of his life."
13776,70212,"If she's going to threaten him with divorce now, maybe it's best that she does take the ring off and keep it off so he can return it and get his money back.

OK perhaps the fiance should not attend the wedding, since she wants to keep the ring on. 

If I were you I would stay out of it and let your parents handle it directly, but suggest giving her a choice of attending without the ring on, or keeping the ring on as she wishes, but not attending your wedding."

This person(s) will guide you to those vendors that will fall within your budget for that particular category or be honest with you about your options and how to accomplish what you want.  And the planner should be a part of your budget and not an additional cost if you should choose to seek one. "
13780,94890,"Dear Breidie,

I understand your concerns about not bringing up the topic and your frustrations about your family asking for the date.
I suggest that you plan a special romantic evening for just two of you at his favorite restaurant. Wear sonething that he really likes on you and get out of your comfort zone and open up to him.

Start by saying ""remember the day we met"" and ""remember our first date"" ...""remember our first kiss"" remind him of how specil that special occasion or a special outing you both loved together...tell him that you always dreamed of having that special feeling you both had on that special day for your wedding day...discuss picking a date for your wedding.

All families are always the same...they expect you to come up with a solution by nagging at your partner...don't let your family members pressure you. Tell them ""The time will come"" it's all in God's hands!

Best wishes to you!

13779,94890,"It's in God's Hands! When he comes home from work...Create a pleasant and comforbale atmosphere for him to relax with candle light dinner and glass of wine if he drinks. after dinner make him a bubble bath with candles and your sexiest lingerie and tell him this is the begining of our marriage will begin after the honeymoon. Talk about it in the tub!

Danelie"
13780,92814,"Try to get him to tell you why it wants to push it off. Ask he about what concerns him about setting a date. Most men might not want to do the big wedding thing and setting the date means that is what is going to happen. Maybe talk about a destination wedding- no hassle and just close friends and family. 
As weird as it shounds ask open ended questions to find out what is really bothering him about it. Start with When, How and stuff like that. make sure he can't say yes or no but have to explain his answer. Hope that helps a little. Good luck"
13642,85834,"We will often customize our packages to meet the needs of our clients.  I think you should speak to several vendors before making any final decisions.  I caution you however, the lowest price is not always the best deal.  "
13573,70212,"Hi, good for you. When I say that please understand I don't see it as a moral thing, I really mean good for YOU. I think you will feel better having done it and you're probably right, he won't actually attend but you sent out good feelings by including him. "
13682,70212,"""As far as the wedding etiquette goes, the bride is smoking crack.""

LOL!

The groom may need some encouragement to be aware that this is not acceptable behavior for a wedding ---or for a relationship! If she is able to do this, think of how else she has and can control him. There are things I let people get away with just because no one told me it was abusive or unacceptable.

Now there is a chance you don't know the whole story and the groom secretly hates his mother or told the bride how the mother abused him but no one knows it...you just don't know.

Have a 1-1 with him and choose your words carefully but get these points across: ""Do you not want your mother?"" 

""the family is concerned that the bride's behavior is mentally abusive and we are concerned for your future life"" 

""if you marry someone you are so scared of displeasing someone who is so controlling and demanding of you, imagine what your marriage is going to be like"" 

""what could the bridedo that you would stand up to?"

13775,94455,"Most of my friends who had traditional weddings where the families lived nearby for the most part said that about 25% of guests decline.

13778,93747,"First of all, the fact that your hubby-to-be gave his imput is wonderful. Secondly, I think it's a creative idea and not to much of a hassel.

The table was a different shape than the rest of the guest tables and it was perpendicular to the other tables so that it stood out.  It worked out perfectly!  And then we sat very close family at the tables on each side of us so that they could be near us as well.  "
13778,93550,"I think that is an awesome idea!

When your stuffing the envelopes you just have to remember which one's go with whom so not too much of a big deal, just divide out the funny part of the list.

13642,72363,"Here is what I suggest.  Find vendors that you like and prices that are close to what you are looking for.  You can ask them to throw in something small for free.  Most vendors would rather add to a package than subtract price.  Example: I'd be willing to give a free engagement session but be less likely to take $300 off a package price.

Asking within reason never hurts.  From the vendor side if someone starts getting pushy with asking for discounts, it can start to look like a red flag.  So go ahead and ask, if you are met with much resistance back off or look elsewhere."

Average wedding photography is around $2,500 or so.  When I started out taking photos I was charging $1000 for wedding photography.

Weddings are about love and spending your life with the person you love, and I think it's really appropriate for your brother and his fiance to celebrate their love as you celebrate yours. I don't see how their engagement detracts from your wedding at all. I can see how the fiance would be offended at being asked to take her ring off; she deserves to be happy with her husband-to-be just as much as you do. I'm reminded of part of my wedding ceremony that really applies here:

""It is my wish and hope that those of you who have already taken the vows of marriage will witness the love of these two people ... and it will even strengthen the bonds of love that have been growing between you. If any of this should happen, it would certainly be the greatest gift that the bride and groom could offer all of us on their wedding day."""

Think about the situation in reverse... if your fiance's family asked you not to wear your ring would you feel OK with that?

Congratulate them and enjoy your day. You can enen make a special speach saying congrats to them early on. then everyone knows and it shows you really care about the union of marriage not being the center of attention."

I finally dropped it and two weeks later he wanted to go look at halls and set a date! we decided to wait over a year ( we got engaged last March and will be married in Sept) by backing off he said he finally felt like i was excited about us getting married not me being excited about the wedding itself.

Hello Breidie,

Breidie, you need to decide what season that you want to get married in. When you decide, you start working on telling him about what you heard about that season. Let say you would want to get married in June. June is the hottest month of the year for weddings, everything gets booked a year or two in advance because of the prom. If you decide on specific month, make him a candle light diner (his favored dish) with a bottle of wine, and at the end of the night mention the wedding with out pushing him. Just start by telling him that someone at that you know is getting married a year or two from now and that they are having a hard time finding vendors that they like, and at the end of the story, you could ask him ""When do you think we should start planning our wedding, so we wouldn't have to pay double the price at the last minute and so we could get everything that you want""? 

Good Luck!!!! I hope that you get an answer soon... Hope I was a little help to you!!!!!"
13806,30382,"I think you should still send out as ""save the dates ' this month!!!
By the time you do all the thngs you mentioned you could get printer ink,LOL, But seriously, summer month weddings need a heads up for guests to plan, they may be going on vacation,or going to other events!
I think the cards might look like an after thought if placed on the reception table alone.

One other idea that I have seen is when a couple does a montage of items in a small frame,this could have the save the dates, an engagement photo and a different story about you on each table. then the guests will want to visit each table to read another fun story about your romance and how you met.

After the wedding you can place each of these stories in a scrapbook with candid photos from the Big day and your honeymoon trip. 

This will be fun for you and the family as the years go by!

Have fun!!"
13813,30382,"A website can be quite fun for you and the guests.

Maps and photos of the wedding location and shared pics from the engagement & wedding and reception after can be an easy way to share the happiness.

Its a good place to put your color prefrences for your home and make gift selection for your friends a bit easier.

Ifyou are asking for donations for a charity insteadof gifts this would be placedon here with links to your favorite causes.
People like to have information at their fingertips these days.

AND it really saves on time the weekof the wedding when everyone calls at the last minute for directions.

have a wonderful wedding!"
13789,24540,"I agree - the save the date/RSVP will generate a response.  The most important part is that you invited your family and gave them the choice to come. You would not want to exclude them.  Having said that you should pick a state.  And if it's TX then just add the state without a specific location.  I think you should what feels right for you and an intimate wedding by the water sounds great!  And if they cannot come to TX - you can always choose to have an informal family gathering in IL after the wedding and have pictures of the wedding to share with them.  Don't worry it will all work itself out and BTW congratulations."
13813,24540,"It depends on your budget.  If you need to pick between the wedding website and something else; I would nix the website.  Having said that, a wedding website is really informative for friends and family who are traveling and don't know the location or those who are not really organized.  Personallly, because we are having a destination wedding a website has been helpful and extremely fun. I have received nothing but great comments. If you can afford it, I would recommend it.  I used www.weddingwindow.com.

13806,92857,"How about using them for table numbers and if you are having a buffet food descriptions. Or as small menus for the guests if you are doing a sit down dinner. "
13766,78470,"I would be horrified if someone asked me not to wear my engagement ring to their wedding because they didn't want any of their thunder stolen.  The day is and will be all about you, regardless of whether or not people know about their recent engagement!  Sure, they'll be offered a few congratulations within personal conversations, but no one will be toasting them, no one will make any big announcements about them.... all of those things will be done about YOU and your husband!  Don't stress.  It's fine if they tell people of their engagement.  Asking them not to share their news will most likely form a rift between you and them, and I sincerely doubt that's worth it."
13820,44446,"I got my dress first and the wedding design took off from there.  I am using my gown to set the tone of my wedding.  So I picked my flowers, reception decor, cake design, ceremony setup, invitations etc. based on how I thought about my dress.  Really once I had my dress everything just clicked for me in terms of how I wanted to personalize my day and express the love that my FH and I have for each other.  My FH is onboard with everything I am doing and I am keeping his style in mind as I pick out everything.  I think you should just focus on what makes you and your FH happy and personalize your wedding from there.

Then honor your friends by allowing them and a guest to enjoy your special day.  

 "
13820,24540,"Your'e right.  A friend designed and made my save the dates as a gift and will be doing the invitations as well.  It was important to me to have Mr. Starfish's tastes reflected in the selection of the cards.  Having him be part of the process is very important.  And I believe our decision of colors was really important.  It was hard. As we are having a semi formal beach wedding.  We finally chose chocolate brown with accents of mustard and light blue.  He likes the brown and the blue, the mustard color is more me.  We both love earth tones.  The one thing we are focusing on is the ceremony and what we will say and have read.  It's funny because I design expensive spaces for a living, and it is the small intimate things that matter most.  Thank you for your insight. "
13771,24540,"This may sound a bit technical but make sure that the glass floor tiles are made for floors.  There are technical slip resistant requirements for tiles.  It cannot be too smooth otherwise it could be a hazard. However there are alot of manufacturers that make great tiles, Bisazza tile and Anne Sacks are on the high end and I believe Dal tile makes glass tile on the more mid range.  Good luck"
13778,56581,"The idea of having two save the dates I think is a cool idea. My only words of caution would be that you want to make sure no one is offended that they did not get the funny one if they know about the two different ones. It also might end up being more expensive to have two designs, but I would go for it!"
13813,56581,"It is up to you, but I have enjoyed seeing them for weddings that I am attending and I am in the process of creating my own. Wedding websites are wonderful for guests, even if you do not have a lot of out of town guests. You can put any vital information on it like directions, parking information, and gift registries. You can also post pictures and stories that your guests will enjoy seeing. Overall, for the time that you put in to creating a website, I think your guests will really appreciate it. Take a look at the wedding website you can create for free here on Wedding Wire, they have some great features and decent layouts that you can personalize easily."
13824,56581,"I would use the amount you are spending on your other attendant gifts as your guide. I would think something like $20-$50 would be appropriate. You may also want to do gift certificates instead of cash, especially if you are giving all of your attendants their gifts at the same time. But don't feel compelled to give them cash. A thank you gift should be given from your heart, not a request."
13789,56581,"If you want to get an idea about how many people will be coming from out of town, you can also call them and simply ask if they think that they would be able to go. Just by saying something like, ""Hi. I just wanted to let you know that we plan on getting married in TX and would love for you do be there. Do you think you could make it?"" It saves you the trouble of having to wait for all of those RSVP cards to make their way back to you and gives you the chance to talk with friends and family."
11257,95649,"... you should do it if it is what you want... dont worry about if someone thinks it is tacky.  as long as it reflects your personality. GO FOR IT. honestly it is something i have thought of too. me and my fi both love to hunt and fish."
13830,95649,"... i have also toyed with the idea of chocolate brown and pink. yes?..no?"
13792,94729,"Yes I think that is too much. "
13684,95672,"The return address on the invitation envelopes would be whom ever is hosting the wedding; usually the bride's parents."
12952,95672,"For my wedding, I had 2 bridesmaids out of town.  What I did was go get paint chip samples in the color that I liked for the dresses, sent all my bridesmaids the color samples and let them choose their own appropriate dresses in that color.  Some bought dresses, and others had them made.  It turned out great at the wedding, and everyone felt comfortable in their dresses."
13834,61966,"It sounds like he might be worried that if you rush into getting married it'll turn out like his last marriage, and I'm sure that's the last thing he wants to happen. It'll be especially rough if you guys get married and have a long distance relationship, that just compounds the troubles. I don't see what's wrong with 2011, so you guys will be living together, and you won't need to push it off longer (you mentioned you had 3 things happening that year; it's a whole year! I'm sure you can make time for one other event). 
Maybe you should sit down and have a serious talk with him. Tell him how much it means to you and find out his reasons for wanting to wait. You should work things out as mature adults and maybe come to a conclusion on which date works best for you. I wouldn't tell people you're not getting married unless that was the truth. There's nothing wrong with saying that you've decided to wait."
13820,61966,"My whole story is kind of crazy because we had about three months to plan the wedding from when we decided to actually go through with it (we were going to wait until after I was done serving in the Navy, but on a whim decided to get married before). I had always heard it took a year or more to plan a wedding, but I haven't had any trouble at all. We started by booking our venue, and we got lucky enough to find this perfect place that hosts the ceremony, caters the reception, includes the cake, bar, dance floor, and minimal decorations. That alone cut out so much of the planning since everything was practically taken care of. We made our own invitations and decorations (minus the flowers), my mom made our favors, we're putting together playlists (instead of having a DJ).... I guess the one thing I really splurged on was my dress, but aside from that it's been very low-key and surprisingly easy to organize. Good luck with your wedding! "
13834,70212,"Hi Keeyoh,

Thanks, this is a good advice. I posted the issue on a few boards and got so much different advice I have to pick and choose which feels right. Someone else said to not bring it up for a few weeks and be less available and I also think that is good advice.

I also had someone say he just wants to date me, someone else say he's not setting the date because he's getting marital benefits (sex) without the responsibility and that got me soooo upset.

A couple of other people said tell him to s*&^! or get off the pot. I don't think that would be productive. One said to have my daughter live with a relative and stay in school while I move in with him and have her stay with us on the weekends. I'm not going to do that!

But I think we need to calm down and then like you said, agree on a date even if it is in 2011.

And I didn't really mean I'd tell people we weren't getting married, I was just being emotional and a bit silly. :)

Thanks again,

Breidie"

13834,26876,"I think the last thing a man wants is a nagging Fiance, let alone a nagging wife. I would just drop it for now. I mean if your really considering getting marriend in 2011, thats a while from now. There is no need to be stressing over it. I know its frustrating, but men don't think like we do, they see it from a very different perspective. The more pressure you put on him, the more your going to drive him away. Use this time to save for a future wedding, and although the only thing you want is to not talk to him. Thats the worst thing you can do right now, especially if you really love him and want to start a life with him. I think that you should put away your pride, and set a time to talk to him, not about the wedding but about how you feel, and he is making you feel, and also how he feels. Although, you may have voiced that to him already, you need to do it in a manner that is non-confrontational, so he wont feel threatened. Communication is all you have right now, so use it! "
13834,70212,"Hi Christina,

Thanks. But I DID talk to him calmly Saturday. that this is hurting me and I feel like he's not as committed and it's putting a wall up, I feel myself getting distant even though I don't want to be. He said I'm being impatient, I need to be more patient, this is a ""process"" & he hasn't had time to think about it until now so he needs time.

But the signs seem like hes not into it. What he said about marriage sex. What he said about dont look at the wedding and don't get any ideas. The fact that he said goodbye to me this morning when I was sleeping, he couldn't wait until I woke up. And when I was upset he left anyway.  I feel like he doesn't care and he's treating me badly.

Then again he was so good to me on Sat and I'm leaving all of that stuff out because I'm upset. He took me out to dinner Fri; he said he'd look housesSat he told me a few times that he doesn't care what we do, he just wants to be with me, and signed up to volunteer work I was doing just to be with m"
13612,83828,"I just went to Davids Bridal in Waldorf and got a beautiful dress for little of nothing. Right now they have an 'up to $300 off every wedding dress' sale, so I took advantage of that!"
13612,67772,"I did David's Bridal..my dress was originally $600 and I got it for $500.  It's beautiful everything I wanted & I didn't have to spend an arm & a leg on it.  My dress was impt to me, but I didn't wanna spend too much.  David's has all kinda of dresses, including some from big name designers....if u want a non-DB brand, ask them to show u only the designers they carry.  Although, i found that many of the designer gowns I tried on I could find a replica in a WAY cheaper price in DB brand.  Good luck!"
13776,70212,"It's a very well known and time-honored etiquette to NOT announce one's engagement at someone else's wedding. That would be considered bad form and stealing someone else's thunder.

That is why the parents are doing this; it's very traditional to do so."
13845,70212,"Hi,

I know it doesn't seem fair, and you really need to do what you want to do for your wedding, not what everyone else wants, but how close are you to your step-mother and how old were you when she entered your life?

I would think of it as doing it for your step-mother and not for her mother. So think about if your step-mother has been a mother to you or not when you make your decision.

Breidie"
13843,26876,"If you don't feel close to them, then you shouldn't feel obligated to put them in your program. And yes, your biological grandparents deserve to there, especially if you were close to them. It might even cause confusion by putting your step-grandparents. You need to be honest with you stepmother and let her know how you feel, and hopefully she will understand."

13642,80210,"I am a musician and custom music coordinator and my services are rendered at set prices for each group, with no negotiation.  What I do offer however, are groups of different sizes to fit various budget points and a couple of free extra services that might save you some money in another area.  I have gone to a set price list because I know that brides are reluctant to say what they want to spend, perhaps because they've been burned by unscrupulous vendors who find out their budget and then figure out a way to spend all of it.  Rest assured that most of us aren't like that!  So, go ahead and ask but try to keep in mind that we are professionals who need to make a living wage and so don't be upset if we can't meet your budget.  If I am contacted by a bride who simply can't afford my services, I'm always happy to suggest alternatives that might be a better fit.  Good luck!"

13789,85242,"It's not tacky at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me tell you what I think is tacky....if you family does not show up for your wedding celebration.&nbsp;&nbsp;Family should always make an attempt to come where ever you plan to have your wedding unless they can't be cause of health or serious financial problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise there shouldn't be no excuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you give them ample time to get there travel arrangements together...I don't think it should be a problem for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm having a destination wedding in Jamaica and I haven't had a problem with family not wanting to come yet. "
13776,85242,"Your wedding day will still be all about you.  Your family memeber probably won't even notice the ring on her finger.  I think it's not fair for your parents to ask your brothers fiance not to wear her ring."
13485,96243,"I'm a calligrapher! ;)"
13843,92814,"I agree- It should be what you are wanting it to say- If you didn't  know her mother or felt she was there for you you should not have to put it on the program. One thing to keep in mind- who is paying for the wedding? If your dad and step mother are paying for it it might be nice to just do it and have her name on the program. I know my mom is going to want some stuff that i don't but when they are paying for more then half i don't mind doing some stuff to please her. Do with what your heart is telling you. Hope that helped. "
13642,96185,"I think that yes you can negotiate with your vendor, but of course within reason. Be upfront with what you are looking for and what your expectations are, and hopefully you can work together. I am an event co-ordinator at a country club, and if a bride wants her wedding here and needs to be within a certain budget, I always work with them and help them get the day they are looking for. It's your day and you should have it the way you want it, and if a vendor really wants your business, they should be willing to work with you. "
13778,95223,"I don't see anything wrong with it. I think two is a really cool idea. Vistaprnt (www.vistaprint.com) is rather inexpensive (and currently has the magnets for half off) and a good quality. The only downside is like someone else stated if someone is offended by getting one and not the other. But you could avoid that by saying they were randomly mailed *smile* "
13775,10284,"Approximatel 20% of invited guests will not be able to attend."
13873,10284,"Tipping - although expected - is not required and it simply given for outstanding service.  Caterers, reception site, wait staff, and bartenders usually have 20% tip included in their contracts. Parking attendants and coat check staff should be tipped in advance - approximately $2 per guest or car. Limo Drivers and DJ's normally receive 20% of the conracted fee as tip. Florists, photographers and bakers are not usually tipped but again if the service is remarkable then by all means. An officiant is never tipped.  If you would like to make a donation to the officiants' house of worship that would be more appropriate."
13441,77548,"Talk to your vendors now!! As a cake maker, I can accomodate a ""rush job"" and I can come up with creative ways to provide custom service within a budget but both are not an option for me.  Go back, set a realistic budget, RANK your priorities and talk to your vendors to see how/if they can accomodate your new budget and priorities. 

A couple once contacted me, they wanted a cake and champagne reception, perfect for a late evening event or Friday night.  Their priority was to have a elegant looking yet casual reception that was basically a big fun party - it worked for them.

The sooner you talk to your vendors with a realistic budget, the better service you will get.  Be mindful of the fact that a vendor may have already declined business because s/he was booked by you. 

If all else fails, you may have to forgo your deposit and cancel now in order to avoid more debt - paying for a service that is not really as important to you as others and that is not within your budget."
13867,56581,"I don't think it could ever be ""bad etiquette"" to include your family and friends in the celebration of your relationship, just make sure to emphasize the meaning of having a wedding/reception that includes others. It think it treads the ""bad etiquette"" line if you are doing it (or your guests believe you are doing it) mainly for the gifts or some other petty reason. You can certainly go the reception-only route, but if your idea of ""doing it right"" involves renewing your vows/having a symbolic ceremony, then go for it!"
13874,56581,"Traditionally, the bride's name appears first on all printed stationary such as the invitations, thank you cards, and the program. While very traditional invitations have the first-middle-last name format, programs tend to only have first-last names on them, unless you want all of your stationary to match in both style and formality and mimic your invitations. If you really can't make up your mind, go with what looks best! For example, I have a longer middle name then my FH, so it just looks better to have only our first and last names in print."
13863,56581,"Since it varies from church to church/religion to religion, either ask the minister or someone of authority within the church what an appropriate donation would be. Some clergy are not allowed to accept payment of any kind or the church may have a standard contribution that they request from anyone that is married in the church."
13867,39625,"It's not bad etiquette at all!
My fiancé and I are being married June 27th at our favorite place in Cincinnati, in front of immediate family. July 19th we are being married in his boyhood church in Missouri, for his relatives and such to attend. I say married the second time because it will be the first religious ceremony. Then on August 2nd in Canada, we are renewing our vows in a cathedral basilica in front of all my family.

Unfortunately, it was the only way to accommodate everyone and still have the wedding we want. You can check out our wedding website! It's all explained there!

13863,92291,"Don't be embarrassed to ask the minister...they don't perform the ceremonies for income, they do it because they enjoy it."
13887,20427,"I have heard bad things about An American Wedding, but I can't personally say I have any problems with them. I would say, look for a local boutique. Somewhere you can pick them up, and actually talk to a person and design something in front of you. If you insist on an online vendor, I personally like Rexcraft. "
13874,26876,"I think on the program its normally just your first names, at least thats how i have seen it always. Regarding whether who's name should go first, I think that should be upto you and not so much etiquitte. I find it kinda wrong that the bride should be first in everything, as if it were only her day. "
13883,26876,"I had two favors as well, I had personalized wine bottles(one per family) and at every setting I had miniature wine glasses with personalized mints wrapped in tulle. It complimented each other so I think it worked great. Consider doing something that would compliment the candle, like maybe everyone gets a matchbox that says a perfect match or something like that. "
13783,11063,"My fiance and I had been talking about marriage, so it wasn't a total surprise, but still I had no idea when or how he was going to actually ask.  We were going away for the weekend before Christmas, so earlier that week, he told me that he had been unable to get me the gift he wanted to get me.  He then told me that he wanted to get me a ring, but that he wasn't able to get the one he wanted and he wanted to make sure that I loved what I got him.  So, that weekend, we went ring shopping during our weekend away.  It was actually very fun and very sweet, and we got the perfect ring for us.  That night, we went for a walk along the marina, and he got down on one knee and asked me formally.  I melted and of course said yes (duh)!  Maybe not conventional, but it definitely fit us!"
13909,70212,"Of course it's appropriate for your mother to walk you down the aisle!

The tradition was fathers because back then mothers didn't have property rights of their own property, rights to their own wages they worked for, or guardianship of their own biological children!

I'm Jewish and in our religion both parents walk us down the aisle."
